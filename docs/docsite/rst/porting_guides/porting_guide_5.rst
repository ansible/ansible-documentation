Ansible 5 Porting Guide
=======================

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 2


Ansible 5 is based on Ansible-core 2.12.


We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible 5 Changelog <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/5/CHANGELOG-v5.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.


Playbook
========

* When calling tasks and setting ``async``, setting ``ANSIBLE_ASYNC_DIR`` under ``environment:`` is no longer valid. Instead, use the shell configuration variable ``async_dir``, for example by setting ``ansible_async_dir``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   tasks:
     - dnf:
         name: '*'
         state: latest
       async: 300
       poll: 5
       vars:
         ansible_async_dir: /path/to/my/custom/dir

* The ``undef()`` function is added to the templating environment for creating undefined variables directly in a template. Optionally, a hint may be provided for variables which are intended to be overridden.

.. code-block:: yaml

   vars:
     old: "{{ undef }}"
     new: "{{ undef() }}"
     new_with_hint: "{{ undef(hint='You must override this variable') }}"

Python Interpreter Discovery
============================

The default value of ``INTERPRETER_PYTHON`` changed to ``auto``. The list of Python interpreters in ``INTERPRETER_PYTHON_FALLBACK`` changed to prefer Python 3 over Python 2. The combination of these two changes means the new default behavior is to quietly prefer Python 3 over Python 2 on remote hosts. Previously a deprecation warning was issued in situations where interpreter discovery would have used Python 3 but the interpreter was set to ``/usr/bin/python``.

``INTERPRETER_PYTHON_FALLBACK`` can be changed from the default list of interpreters by setting the ``ansible_interpreter_python_fallback`` variable.

See :ref:`interpreter discovery documentation <interpreter_discovery>` for more details.


Command Line
============

* Python 3.8 on the controller node is a hard requirement for this release. The command line scripts will not function with a lower Python version.
* ``ansible-vault`` no longer supports ``PyCrypto`` and requires ``cryptography``.

Deprecated
==========

* Python 2.6 on the target node is deprecated in this release. ``ansible-core`` 2.13 will remove support for Python 2.6.
* Bare variables in conditionals: ``when`` conditionals no longer automatically parse string booleans such as ``"true"`` and ``"false"`` into actual booleans. Any variable containing a non-empty string is considered true. This was previously configurable with the ``CONDITIONAL_BARE_VARS`` configuration option (and the ``ANSIBLE_CONDITIONAL_BARE_VARS`` environment variable). This setting no longer has any effect. Users can work around the issue by using the ``|bool`` filter:

.. code-block:: yaml

    vars:
      teardown: 'false'

    tasks:
      - include_tasks: teardown.yml
        when: teardown | bool

      - include_tasks: provision.yml
        when: not teardown | bool

* The ``_remote_checksum()`` method in ``ActionBase`` is deprecated. Any action plugin using this method should use ``_execute_remote_stat()`` instead.

Modules
=======

* ``cron`` now requires ``name`` to be specified in all cases.
* ``cron`` no longer allows a ``reboot`` parameter. Use ``special_time: reboot`` instead.
* ``hostname`` - On FreeBSD, the ``before`` result will no longer be ``"temporarystub"`` if permanent hostname file does not exist. It will instead be ``""`` (empty string) for consistency with other systems.
* ``hostname`` - On OpenRC and Solaris based systems, the ``before`` result will no longer be ``"UNKNOWN"`` if the permanent hostname file does not exist. It will instead be ``""`` (empty string) for consistency with other systems.
* ``pip`` now uses the ``pip`` Python module installed for the Ansible module's Python interpreter, if available, unless ``executable`` or ``virtualenv`` were specified.


Modules removed
---------------

The following modules no longer exist:

* No notable changes


Deprecation notices

Noteworthy module changes
-------------------------

No notable changes


Plugins
=======

* ``unique`` filter with Jinja2 < 2.10 is case-sensitive and now raise coherently an error if ``case_sensitive=False`` instead of when ``case_sensitive=True``.
* Set theory filters (``intersect``, ``difference``, ``symmetric_difference`` and ``union``) are now case-sensitive. Explicitly use ``case_sensitive=False`` to keep previous behavior. Note: with Jinja2 < 2.10, the filters were already case-sensitive by default.
* ``password_hash``` now uses ``passlib`` defaults when an option is unspecified, for example ``bcrypt_sha256``, now default to the "2b" format and if the "2a" format is required it must be specified.

Porting Guide for v5.9.0
========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- cisco.dnac (version 6.4.0)
- community.sap_libs (version 1.1.0)

Major Changes
-------------

fortinet.fortios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support FortiOS 7.0.2, 7.0.3, 7.0.4, 7.0.5.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- The collection ``community.sap`` has been renamed to ``community.sap_libs``. For now both collections are included in Ansible. The content in ``community.sap`` will be replaced with deprecated redirects to the new collection in Ansible 7.0.0, and these redirects will eventually be removed from Ansible. Please update your FQCNs for ``community.sap``.

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 is deprecated, and will be removed in the next major release (community.docker 3.0.0). Some modules might still work with these versions afterwards, but we will no longer keep compatibility code that was needed to support them (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/361).
- The dependency on docker-compose for Execution Environments is deprecated and will be removed in community.docker 3.0.0. The `Python docker-compose library <https://pypi.org/project/docker-compose/>`__ is unmaintained and can cause dependency issues. You can manually still install it in an Execution Environment when needed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/373).
- Various modules - the default of ``tls_hostname`` that was supposed to be removed in community.docker 2.0.0 will now be removed in version 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/362).
- docker_stack - the return values ``out`` and ``err`` that were supposed to be removed in community.docker 2.0.0 will now be removed in version 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/362).

Porting Guide for v5.8.0
========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- vmware.vmware_rest (version 2.1.5)

Breaking Changes
----------------

vmware.vmware_rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The vmware_rest 2.0.0 support vSphere 7.0.2 onwards.
- vcenter_vm_storage_policy - the format of the ``disks`` parameter has changed.
- vcenter_vm_storage_policy - the module has a new mandatory parameter: ``vm_home``.

Major Changes
-------------

community.mysql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The community.mysql collection no longer supports ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base 2.10``. While we take no active measures to prevent usage and there are no plans to introduce incompatible code to the modules, we will stop testing against ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base 2.10``. Both will very soon be End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading to the ``latest Ansible / ansible-core 2.11 or later`` as soon as possible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/343).

community.postgresql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The community.postgresql collection no longer supports ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base 2.10``. While we take no active measures to prevent usage and there are no plans to introduce incompatible code to the modules, we will stop testing against ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base 2.10``. Both will very soon be End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading to the ``latest Ansible / ansible-core 2.11 or later`` as soon as possible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/pull/245).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

community.hashi_vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- token_validate options - the shared auth option ``token_validate`` will change its default from ``True`` to ``False`` in community.hashi_vault version 4.0.0. The ``vault_login`` lookup and module will keep the default value of ``True`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/248).

community.network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 is deprecated, and will be removed in the next major release (community.network 4.0.0) this spring. While most content will probably still work with ansible-base 2.10, we will remove symbolic links for modules and action plugins, which will make it impossible to use them with Ansible 2.9 anymore. Please use community.network 3.x.y with Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10, as these releases will continue to support Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 even after they are End of Life (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/50, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/382).

vmware.vmware_rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- vcenter_vm_storage_policy_compliance - drop the module, it returns 404 error.
- vcenter_vm_tools - remove the ``upgrade`` state.
- vcenter_vm_tools_installer - remove the module from the collection.

Porting Guide for v5.7.0
========================

Major Changes
-------------

community.postgresql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- postgresql_user - the ``priv`` argument has been deprecated and will be removed in ``community.postgresql 3.0.0``. Please use the ``postgresql_privs`` module to grant/revoke privileges instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/issues/212).

fortinet.fortios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support FortiOS 7.0.2, 7.0.3, 7.0.4, 7.0.5.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- nmcli - deprecate default hairpin mode for a bridge. This so we can change it to ``false`` in community.general 7.0.0, as this is also the default in ``nmcli`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4334).
- proxmox inventory plugin - the current default ``true`` of the ``want_proxmox_nodes_ansible_host`` option has been deprecated. The default will change to ``false`` in community.general 6.0.0. To keep the current behavior, explicitly set ``want_proxmox_nodes_ansible_host`` to ``true`` in your inventory configuration. We suggest to already switch to the new behavior by explicitly setting it to ``false``, and by using ``compose:`` to set ``ansible_host`` to the correct value. See the examples in the plugin documentation for details (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4466).

Porting Guide for v5.6.0
========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- community.sap (version 1.0.0)

Deprecated Features
-------------------

cisco.ios
~~~~~~~~~

- Deprecates lldp module.

Porting Guide for v5.5.0
========================

Known Issues
------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- pacman - ``update_cache`` cannot differentiate between up to date and outdated package lists and will report ``changed`` in both situations (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4318).
- pacman - binaries specified in the ``executable`` parameter must support ``--print-format`` in order to be used by this module. In particular, AUR helper ``yay`` is known not to currently support it (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4312).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- pacman - from community.general 5.0.0 on, the ``changed`` status of ``update_cache`` will no longer be ignored if ``name`` or ``upgrade`` is specified. To keep the old behavior, add something like ``register: result`` and ``changed_when: result.packages | length > 0`` to your task (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4329).

Porting Guide for v5.4.0
========================

Major Changes
-------------

chocolatey.chocolatey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- win_chocolatey - Added choco_args option to pass additional arguments directly to Chocolatey.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

cisco.ios
~~~~~~~~~

- `ios_acls` - Deprecated fragment attribute added boolean alternate as enable_fragment.

Porting Guide for v5.3.0
========================

Major Changes
-------------

f5networks.f5_modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- bigip_device_info - pagination logic has also been added to help with api stability.
- bigip_device_info - the module no longer gathers information from all partitions on device. This change will stabalize the module by gathering resources only from the given partition and prevent the module from gathering way too much information that might result in crashing.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- mail callback plugin - not specifying ``sender`` is deprecated and will be disallowed in community.general 6.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4140).

Porting Guide for v5.2.0
========================

Known Issues
------------

dellemc.openmanage

If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, the existing uplink is modified.

purestorage.flashblade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- purefb_lag - The mac_address field in the response is not populated. This will be fixed in a future FlashBlade update.

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Action, module, and group names in module_defaults must be static values. Their values can still be templates.
- Fully qualified 'ansible.legacy' plugin names are not included implicitly in action_groups.
- Unresolvable groups, action plugins, and modules in module_defaults are an error.
- ansible-test - Automatic installation of requirements for "cloud" test plugins no longer occurs. The affected test plugins are ``aws``, ``azure``, ``cs``, ``hcloud``, ``nios``, ``opennebula``, ``openshift`` and ``vcenter``. Collections should instead use one of the supported integration test requirements files, such as the ``tests/integration/requirements.txt`` file.
- ansible-test - The HTTP Tester is no longer available with the ``ansible-test shell`` command. Only the ``integration`` and ``windows-integration`` commands provide HTTP Tester.
- ansible-test - The ``--disable-httptester`` option is no longer available. The HTTP Tester is no longer optional for tests that specify it.
- ansible-test - The ``--httptester`` option is no longer available. To override the container used for HTTP Tester tests, set the ``ANSIBLE_HTTP_TEST_CONTAINER`` environment variable instead.
- ansible-test - Unit tests for ``modules`` and ``module_utils`` are now limited to importing only ``ansible.module_utils`` from the ``ansible`` module.
- conditionals - ``when`` conditionals no longer automatically parse string booleans such as ``"true"`` and ``"false"`` into actual booleans. Any non-empty string is now considered true. The ``CONDITIONAL_BARE_VARS`` configuration variable no longer has any effect.
- hostname - Drops any remaining support for Python 2.4 by using ``with open()`` to simplify exception handling code which leaked file handles in several spots
- hostname - On FreeBSD, the string ``temporarystub`` no longer gets written to the hostname file in the get methods (and in check_mode). As a result, the default hostname will now appear as ``''`` (empty string) instead of ``temporarystub`` for consistency with other strategies. This means the ``before`` result will be different.
- hostname - On OpenRC systems and Solaris, the ``before`` value will now be ``''`` (empty string) if the permanent hostname file does not exist, for consistency with other strategies.
- intersect, difference, symmetric_difference, union filters - the default behavior is now to be case-sensitive (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74255)
- unique filter - the default behavior is now to fail if Jinja2's filter fails and explicit ``case_sensitive=False`` as the Ansible's fallback is case-sensitive (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74256)

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- ec2_instance - instance wait for state behaviour has changed.  If plays require the old behavior of waiting for the instance monitoring status to become ``OK`` when launching a new instance, the action will need to specify ``state: started`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/481).
- ec2_snapshot - support for waiting indefinitely has been dropped, new default is 10 minutes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/356).
- ec2_vol_info - return ``attachment_set`` is now a list of attachments with Multi-Attach support on disk. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/362).
- ec2_vpc_dhcp_option - The module has been refactored to use boto3. Keys and value types returned by the module are now consistent, which is a change from the previous behaviour. A ``purge_tags`` option has been added, which defaults to ``True``.  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
- ec2_vpc_dhcp_option_info - Now preserves case for tag keys in return value. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/252)
- module_utils.core - The boto3 switch has been removed from the region parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/287).
- module_utils/compat - vendored copy of ipaddress removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/461).
- module_utils/core - updated the ``scrub_none_parameters`` function so that ``descend_into_lists`` is set to ``True`` by default (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/297).

arista.eos
~~~~~~~~~~

- Arista released train 4.23.X and newer and along with it replaced and deprecated lots of commands. This PR adds support for syntax changes in release train 4.23 and after. Going forward the eos modules will not support eos sw version < 4.23.

- kms_info - key details are now returned in the ``kms_keys`` attribute rather than the ``keys`` attribute (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/648).

community.crypto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adjust ``dirName`` text parsing and to text converting code to conform to `Sections 2 and 3 of RFC 4514 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4514.html>`_. This is similar to how `cryptography handles this <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/x509/reference/#cryptography.x509.Name.rfc4514_string>`_ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/274).

- compatibility module_utils - removed vendored copy of the Python library ``ipaddress`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/287).
- crypto module utils - removing compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/290).
- get_certificate, openssl_csr_info, x509_certificate_info - depending on the ``cryptography`` version used, the modules might not return the ASN.1 value for an extension as contained in the certificate respectively CSR, but a re-encoded version of it. This should usually be identical to the value contained in the source file, unless the value was malformed. For extensions not handled by C(cryptography) the value contained in the source file is always returned unaltered (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/318).
- module_utils - removed various PyOpenSSL support functions and default backend values that are not needed for the openssl_pkcs12 module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/273).
- openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe, x509_crl - the ``subject`` respectively ``issuer`` fields no longer ignore empty values, but instead fail when encountering them (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
- openssl_privatekey_info - by default consistency checks are not run; they need to be explicitly requested by passing ``check_consistency=true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/309).
- x509_crl - for idempotency checks, the ``issuer`` order is ignored. If order is important, use the new ``issuer_ordered`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).

community.dns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All Hetzner modules and plugins which handle DNS records now work with unquoted TXT values by default. The old behavior can be obtained by setting ``txt_transformation=api`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/issues/48, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/57, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/60).
- Hosttech API creation - now requires a ``ModuleOptionProvider`` object instead of an ``AnsibleModule`` object. Alternatively an Ansible plugin instance can be passed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/37).
- The hetzner_dns_record_info and hosttech_dns_record_info modules have been renamed to hetzner_dns_record_set_info and hosttech_dns_record_set_info, respectively (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/54).
- The hosttech_dns_record module has been renamed to hosttech_dns_record_set (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31).
- The internal bulk record updating helper (``bulk_apply_changes``) now also returns the records that were deleted, created or updated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/63).
- The internal record API no longer allows to manage comments explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/63).
- When using the internal modules API, now a zone ID type and a provider information object must be passed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/27).
- hetzner_dns_record* modules - implement correct handling of default TTL. The value ``none`` is now accepted and returned in this case (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/52, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/issues/50).
- hetzner_dns_record, hetzner_dns_record_set, hetzner_dns_record_sets - the default TTL is now 300 and no longer 3600, which equals the default in the web console (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/43).
- hosttech_* module_utils - completely rewrite and refactor to support new JSON API and allow to re-use provider-independent module logic (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/4).
- hosttech_dns_record_set - the option ``overwrite`` was replaced by a new option ``on_existing``. Specifying ``overwrite=true`` is equivalent to ``on_existing=replace`` (the new default). Specifying ``overwrite=false`` with ``state=present`` is equivalent to ``on_existing=keep_and_fail``, and specifying ``overwrite=false`` with ``state=absent`` is equivalent to ``on_existing=keep`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31).

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_compose - fixed ``timeout`` defaulting behavior so that ``stop_grace_period``, if defined in the compose file, will be used if `timeout`` is not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/163).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- archive - adding idempotency checks for changes to file names and content within the ``destination`` file (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3075).
- lxd inventory plugin - when used with Python 2, the plugin now needs ``ipaddress`` installed `from pypi <https://pypi.org/project/ipaddress/>`_ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/2441).
- scaleway_security_group_rule - when used with Python 2, the module now needs ``ipaddress`` installed `from pypi <https://pypi.org/project/ipaddress/>`_ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/2441).

community.hashi_vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- connection options - there is no longer a default value for the ``url`` option (the Vault address), so a value must be supplied (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/83).

community.okd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- drop python 2 support (https://github.com/openshift/community.okd/pull/93).

community.routeros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- api - due to a programming error, the module never failed on errors. This has now been fixed. If you are relying on the module not failing in case of idempotent commands (resulting in errors like ``failure: already have such address``), you need to adjust your roles/playbooks. We suggest to use ``failed_when`` to accept failure in specific circumstances, for example ``failed_when: "'failure: already have ' in result.msg[0]"`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/39).
- api - splitting commands no longer uses a naive split by whitespace, but a more RouterOS CLI compatible splitting algorithm (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/45).
- command - the module now always indicates that a change happens. If this is not correct, please use ``changed_when`` to determine the correct changed status for a task (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/50).

community.zabbix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- all roles now reference other roles and modules through their fully qualified collection names, which makes Ansible 2.10 minimum supported version for roles (See `issue 477 <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.zabbix/pull/477>`_).

kubernetes.core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Drop python 2 support (https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes.core/pull/86).
- helm_plugin - remove unused ``release_namespace`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes.core/pull/85).
- helm_plugin_info - remove unused ``release_namespace`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes.core/pull/85).
- k8s_cluster_info - returned apis as list to avoid being overwritten in case of multiple version (https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes.core/pull/41).
- k8s_facts - remove the deprecated alias from k8s_facts to k8s_info (https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes.core/pull/125).

netapp.storagegrid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This version introduces a breaking change.
  All modules have been renamed from ``nac_sg_*`` to ``na_sg_*``.
  Playbooks and Roles must be updated to match.

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python Controller Requirement - Python 3.8 or newer is required for the control node (the machine that runs Ansible) (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74013)
- ansible-test - All "cloud" plugins which use containers can now be used with all POSIX and Windows hosts. Previously the plugins did not work with Windows at all, and support for hosts created with the ``--remote`` option was inconsistent.
- ansible-test - Collections can now specify controller and target specific integration test requirements and constraints. If provided, they take precedence over the previously available requirements and constraints files.
- ansible-test - Integration tests run with the ``integration`` command can now be executed on two separate hosts instead of always running on the controller. The target host can be one provided by ``ansible-test`` or by the user, as long as it is accessible using SSH.
- ansible-test - Most container features are now supported under Podman. Previously a symbolic link for ``docker`` pointing to ``podman`` was required.
- ansible-test - New ``--controller`` and ``--target`` / ``--target-python`` options have been added to allow more control over test environments.
- ansible-test - Python 3.8 - 3.10 are now required to run ``ansible-test``, thus matching the Ansible controller Python requirements. Older Python versions (2.6 - 2.7 and 3.5 - 3.10) can still be the target for relevant tests.
- ansible-test - SSH port forwarding and redirection is now used exclusively to make container ports available on non-container hosts. When testing on POSIX systems this requires SSH login as root. Previously SSH port forwarding was combined with firewall rules or other port redirection methods, with some platforms being unsupported.
- ansible-test - Sanity tests always run in isolated Python virtual environments specific to the requirements of each test. The environments are cached.
- ansible-test - Sanity tests are now separated into two categories, controller and target. All tests except ``import`` and ``compile`` are controller tests. The controller tests always run using the same Python version used to run ``ansible-test``. The target tests use the Python version(s) specified by the user, or all available Python versions.
- ansible-test - Sanity tests now use fully pinned requirements that are independent of each other and other test types.
- ansible-test - Tests run with the ``centos6`` and ``default`` test containers now use a PyPI proxy container to access PyPI when Python 2.6 is used. This allows tests running under Python 2.6 to continue functioning even though PyPI is discontinuing support for non-SNI capable clients.
- ansible-test - The ``future-import-boilerplate`` and ``metaclass-boilerplate`` sanity tests are limited to remote-only code. Additionally, they are skipped for collections which declare no support for Python 2.x.
- ansible-test - The ``import`` and ``compile`` sanity tests limit remote-only Python version checks to remote-only code.
- ansible-test - Unit tests for controller-only code now require Python 3.8 or later.
- ansible-test - Version neutral sanity tests now require Python 3.8 or later.
- junit callback - The ``junit_xml`` and ``ordereddict`` Python modules are no longer required to use the ``junit`` callback plugin.

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- amazon.aws collection - Due to the AWS SDKs announcing the end of support for Python less than 3.6 (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.17.64/guide/migrationpy3.html) this collection now requires Python 3.6+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/298).
- amazon.aws collection - The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.18.0`` and ``boto3<1.15.0``. Most modules will continue to work with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatibility with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/502).
- ec2_instance - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_instance``.
- ec2_instance_info - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_instance_info``.

- ec2_vpc_igw - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_igw``.
- ec2_vpc_igw_facts - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_igw_facts``.
- ec2_vpc_igw_info - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_igw_info``.
- ec2_vpc_nat_gateway - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_nat_gateway``.
- ec2_vpc_nat_gateway_facts - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_nat_gateway_info``.
- ec2_vpc_nat_gateway_info - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_nat_gateway_info``.

- dynamodb_table - DynamoDB does not support updating the primary indexes on a table.  Attempts to make such changes are currently ignored but will result in failures after version 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/726).

- iam_server_certificate - Passing file names to the ``cert``, ``chain_cert`` and ``key`` parameters has been deprecated. We recommend using a lookup plugin to read the files instead, see the documentation for an example (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/735).
