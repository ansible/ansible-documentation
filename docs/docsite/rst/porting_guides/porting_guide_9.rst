Breaking Changes
----------------

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.29.0`` and ``boto3<1.26.0``. Most modules will continue to work with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatability with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1763).
- amazon.aws collection - due to the AWS SDKs announcing the end of support for Python less than 3.7 (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/) support for Python less than 3.7 by this collection wss been deprecated in release 6.0.0 and removed in release 7.0.0. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1763).
- module_utils - ``module_utils.urls`` was previously deprecated and has been removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1540).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- collection_version lookup plugin - remove compatibility code for ansible-base 2.10 and ansible-core 2.11 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7269).
- gitlab_project - add ``default_branch`` support for project update. If you used the module so far with ``default_branch`` to update a project, the value of ``default_branch`` was ignored. Make sure that you either do not pass a value if you are not sure whether it is the one you want to have to avoid unexpected breaking changes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7158).
- selective callback plugin - remove compatibility code for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-core 2.10 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7269).

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed support for ansible-core version < 2.15.0.
- vmware_dvs_host - removed defaults for `vmnics` and `lag_uplinks` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/issues/1516).
- vmware_host_acceptance - removed `acceptance_level` and used its options in `state`. This also means there will be no state `list` anymore. In order to get information about the current acceptance level, use the new module `vmware_host_acceptance_info` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/issues/1872).
- vmware_vm_info - added prefix length to IP addresses in vm_network, so they now show up as for example 10.76.33.228/24 instead of just 10.76.33.228 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/issues/1761).

purestorage.flasharray
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- purefa_pgsched - Change `snap_at` and `replicate_at` to be AM or PM hourly number rather than 24-hour time.
- purefa_pgsnap - `now` and `remote` are now mutually exclusive.

community.mysql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The community.mysql collection no longer supports ``ansible-core 2.12`` and ``ansible-core 2.13``. While we take no active measures to prevent usage and there are no plans to introduce incompatible code to the modules, we will stop testing those versions. Both are or will soon be End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading to the ``latest Ansible / ansible-core 2.15 or later`` as soon as possible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/574).
- mysql_role - the ``column_case_sensitive`` argument's default value will be changed to ``true`` in community.mysql 4.0.0. If your playbook expected the column to be automatically uppercased for your roles privileges, you should set this to false explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/578).
- mysql_user - the ``column_case_sensitive`` argument's default value will be changed to ``true`` in community.mysql 4.0.0. If your playbook expected the column to be automatically uppercased for your users privileges, you should set this to false explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/577).

The content in ``ibm.spectrum_virtualize`` will be replaced with deprecated redirects to the new collection in Ansible 10.0.0, and these redirects will eventually be removed from Ansible. Please update your FQCNs for ``ibm.spectrum_virtualize``.

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- ec2_instance - deprecation of ``tenancy`` and ``placement_group`` in favor of ``placement`` attribute  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1825).

cisco.ios
~~~~~~~~~

- ios_snmp_server - deprecate traps.envmon.fan with traps.envmon.fan_enable
- ios_snmp_server - deprecate traps.mpls_vpn with traps.mpls

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CmdRunner module utils - deprecate ``cmd_runner_fmt.as_default_type()`` formatter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6601).
- MH VarsMixin module utils - deprecates ``VarsMixin`` and supporting classes in favor of plain ``vardict`` module util (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6649).
- ansible_galaxy_install - the ``ack_ansible29`` and ``ack_min_ansiblecore211`` options have been deprecated and will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7358).

- ejabberd_user - deprecate the parameter ``logging`` in favour of producing more detailed information in the module output (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7043).
- flowdock - module relies entirely on no longer responsive API endpoints, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6930).
- proxmox - old feature flag ``proxmox_default_behavior`` will be removed in community.general 10.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6836).
- proxmox_kvm - deprecate the option ``proxmox_default_behavior`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7377).

- redhat module utils - the ``module_utils.redhat`` module is deprecated, as
  effectively unused: the ``Rhsm``, ``RhsmPool``, and ``RhsmPools`` classes
  will be removed in community.general 9.0.0; the ``RegistrationBase`` class
  will be removed in community.general 10.0.0 together with the
  ``rhn_register`` module, as it is the only user of this class; this means
  that the whole ``module_utils.redhat`` module will be dropped in
  community.general 10.0.0, so importing it without even using anything of it
  will fail
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6663).
- redhat_subscription - the ``autosubscribe`` alias for the ``auto_attach`` option has been
  deprecated for many years, although only in the documentation. Officially mark this alias
  as deprecated, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6646).
- redhat_subscription - the ``pool`` option is deprecated in favour of the
  more precise and flexible ``pool_ids`` option
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6650).
- rhsm_repository - ``state=present`` has not been working as expected for many years,
  and it seems it was not noticed so far; also, "presence" is not really a valid concept
  for subscription repositories, which can only be enabled or disabled. Hence, mark the
  ``present`` and ``absent`` values of the ``state`` option as deprecated, slating them
  for removal in community.general 10.0.0
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6673).
- stackdriver - module relies entirely on no longer existent API endpoints, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6887).
- webfaction_app - module relies entirely on no longer existent API endpoints, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6909).

- webfaction_domain - module relies entirely on no longer existent API endpoints, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6909).
- webfaction_mailbox - module relies entirely on no longer existent API endpoints, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6909).
- webfaction_site - module relies entirely on no longer existent API endpoints, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6909).

Porting Guide for v9.0.0a3
==========================

Deprecated Features
-------------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Old style vars plugins which use the entrypoints `get_host_vars` or `get_group_vars` are deprecated. The plugin should be updated to inherit from `BaseVarsPlugin` and define a `get_vars` method as the entrypoint.

cisco.ios
~~~~~~~~~

- ospfv2 - removed passive_interface to passive_interfaces that supports a list of interfaces

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The next major release, community.general 8.0.0, will drop support for ansible-core 2.11 and 2.12, which have been End of Life for some time now. This means that this collection no longer supports Python 2.6 on the target. Individual content might still work with unsupported ansible-core versions, but that can change at any time. Also please note that from now on, for every new major community.general release, we will drop support for all ansible-core versions that have been End of Life for more than a few weeks on the date of the major release (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/discussions/271, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7259).
- redfish_info, redfish_config, redfish_command - the default value ``10`` for the ``timeout`` option is deprecated and will change to ``60`` in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7295).

- Any plugin using the config system and the `cli` entry to use the `timeout` from the command line, will see the value change if the use had configured it in any of the lower precedence methods. If relying on this behaviour to consume the global/generic timeout from the DEFAULT_TIMEOUT constant, please consult the documentation on plugin configuration to add the overlaping entries.
- ansible-test - Test plugins that rely on containers no longer support reusing running containers. The previous behavior was an undocumented, untested feature.
- service module will not permanently configure variables/flags for openbsd when doing enable/disable operation anymore, this module was never meant to do this type of work, just to manage the service state itself. A rcctl_config or similar module should be created and used instead.

- The deprecated servicenow.servicenow collection has been removed from Ansible 7, but accidentally re-added to Ansible 8. It has been removed again from Ansible 9 (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/246).
- The ngine_io.vultr collection has been removed from Ansible 9, because it is officially unmaintained and has been archived. The successor collection ``vultr.cloud`` (using the recent v2 Vultr API) covers the same functionality but might not have compatible syntax (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/257).
- ``cisco.nso`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.nso``.
- ``community.fortios`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.fortios``.
- ``community.google`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.google``.
- ``community.skydive`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_.

- win_reboot - Removed backwards compatibility check where ``ignore_errors: true`` will be treated like ``ignore_unreachable: true``. Going forward ``ignore_errors: true`` will only ignore errors the plugin encountered and not an unreachable host. Use ``ignore_unreachable: true`` to ignore that error like any other module.
- win_regedit - Removed support for using a ``path`` with forward slashes as a key separator. Using a forward slash has been deprecated since Ansible 2.9. If using forward slashes in the ``win_regedit`` ``path`` value, make sure to change the forward slash ``/`` to a backslash ``\``.
