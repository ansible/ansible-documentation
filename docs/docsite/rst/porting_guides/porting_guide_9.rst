Porting Guide for v9.0.0a3
==========================

Deprecated Features
-------------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Old style vars plugins which use the entrypoints `get_host_vars` or `get_group_vars` are deprecated. The plugin should be updated to inherit from `BaseVarsPlugin` and define a `get_vars` method as the entrypoint.

cisco.ios
~~~~~~~~~

- ospfv2 - removed passive_interface to passive_interfaces that supports a list of interfaces

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The next major release, community.general 8.0.0, will drop support for ansible-core 2.11 and 2.12, which have been End of Life for some time now. This means that this collection no longer supports Python 2.6 on the target. Individual content might still work with unsupported ansible-core versions, but that can change at any time. Also please note that from now on, for every new major community.general release, we will drop support for all ansible-core versions that have been End of Life for more than a few weeks on the date of the major release (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/discussions/271, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7259).
- redfish_info, redfish_config, redfish_command - the default value ``10`` for the ``timeout`` option is deprecated and will change to ``60`` in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7295).

Porting Guide for v9.0.0a1
==========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- telekom_mms.icinga_director (version 1.34.1)

Known Issues
------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-galaxy - dies in the middle of installing a role when that role contains Java inner classes (files with $ in the file name).  This is by design, to exclude temporary or backup files. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81553).
- ansible-test - The ``pep8`` sanity test is unable to detect f-string spacing issues (E201, E202) on Python 3.10 and 3.11. They are correctly detected under Python 3.12. See (https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/1190).

dellemc.openmanage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ca_path missing - Issue(275740) - The roles idrac_attributes, redfish_storage_volume, and idrac_server_powerstate have a missing parameter ca_path.
- idrac_firmware - Issue(276335) - This module fails on the Python 3.11.x version with NFS shares. Use a different Python version or Share type.
- idrac_redfish_storage_controller - Issue(256164) - If incorrect value is provided for one of the attributes in the provided attribute list for controller configuration, then this module does not exit with error.
- ome_device_network_services - Issue(212681) - The module does not provide a proper error message if unsupported values are provided for the following parameters- port_number, community_name, max_sessions, max_auth_retries, and idle_timeout.
- ome_device_power_settings - Issue(212679) - The module displays the following message if the value provided for the parameter ``power_cap`` is not within the supported range of 0 to 32767, ``Unable to complete the request because PowerCap does not exist or is not applicable for the resource URI.``

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Any plugin using the config system and the `cli` entry to use the `timeout` from the command line, will see the value change if the use had configured it in any of the lower precedence methods. If relying on this behaviour to consume the global/generic timeout from the DEFAULT_TIMEOUT constant, please consult the documentation on plugin configuration to add the overlaping entries.
- ansible-test - Test plugins that rely on containers no longer support reusing running containers. The previous behavior was an undocumented, untested feature.
- service module will not permanently configure variables/flags for openbsd when doing enable/disable operation anymore, this module was never meant to do this type of work, just to manage the service state itself. A rcctl_config or similar module should be created and used instead.

dellemc.enterprise_sonic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- sonic_aaa - Add default_auth attribute to the argspec to replace the deleted group and local attributes. This change allows for ordered login authentication. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/195).

hetzner.hcloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Drop support for ansible-core 2.12
- Drop support for python 3.7
- hcloud-python 1.20.0 is now required for full compatibility
- inventory plugin - Don't set the server image variables (`image_id`, `image_os_flavor` and `image_name`) when the server image is not defined.

----------------

- The deprecated servicenow.servicenow collection has been removed from Ansible 7, but accidentally re-added to Ansible 8. It has been removed again from Ansible 9 (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/246).
- The ngine_io.vultr collection has been removed from Ansible 9, because it is officially unmaintained and has been archived. The successor collection ``vultr.cloud`` (using the recent v2 Vultr API) covers the same functionality but might not have compatible syntax (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/257).
- ``cisco.nso`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.nso``.
- ``community.fortios`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.fortios``.
- ``community.google`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.google``.
- ``community.skydive`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_.

- ``fetch_url`` - remove auto disabling ``decompress`` when gzip is not available
- ``get_action_args_with_defaults`` - remove deprecated ``redirected_names`` method parameter

- win_package - Removed deprecated module option ``productid``, use ``product_id`` instead.
- win_package - Removed deprecated module option ``username``, ``user_name``, ``password``, and ``user_password``. Use ``become`` with ``become_flags: logon_type=new_credentials logon_flags=netcredentials_only`` on the task instead to replicate the same functionality instead.
- win_reboot - Removed backwards compatibility check where ``ignore_errors: true`` will be treated like ``ignore_unreachable: true``. Going forward ``ignore_errors: true`` will only ignore errors the plugin encountered and not an unreachable host. Use ``ignore_unreachable: true`` to ignore that error like any other module.
- win_regedit - Removed support for using a ``path`` with forward slashes as a key separator. Using a forward slash has been deprecated since Ansible 2.9. If using forward slashes in the ``win_regedit`` ``path`` value, make sure to change the forward slash ``/`` to a backslash ``\``. If enclosed in double quotes the backslash will have to be doubled up.
- win_updates - Removed deprecated alias ``blacklist``, use ``reject_list`` instead.
- win_updates - Removed deprecated alias ``whitelist``, use ``accept_list`` instead.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- The ``community.azure`` collection is officially unmaintained and has been archived. Therefore, it will be removed from Ansible 10. There is already a successor collection ``azure.azcollection`` in the community package which should cover the same functionality (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/263).
- The ``hpe.nimble`` collection is considered unmaintained and will be removed from Ansible 10 if no one starts maintaining it again before Ansible 10. See `the removal process for details on how this works <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#cancelling-removal-of-an-unmaintained-collection>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/254).
- The collection ``community.sap`` has been renamed to ``community.sap_libs``. For now both collections are included in Ansible.

Please update your FQCNs for ``community.sap``.
- The collection ``t_systems_mms.icinga_director`` has been renamed to ``telekom_mms.icinga_director``. For now both collections are included in Ansible.

- support for Python 2.6 nad 2.7
- support for ansible 2.9

community.crypto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- get_certificate - the default ``false`` of the ``asn1_base64`` option is deprecated and will change to ``true`` in community.crypto 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/600).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CmdRunner module utils - deprecate ``cmd_runner_fmt.as_default_type()`` formatter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6601).
- MH VarsMixin module utils - deprecates ``VarsMixin`` and supporting classes in favor of plain ``vardict`` module util (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6649).
- cpanm - value ``compatibility`` is deprecated as default for parameter ``mode`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6512).
- ejabberd_user - deprecate the parameter ``logging`` in favour of producing more detailed information in the module output (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7043).
- flowdock - module relies entirely on no longer responsive API endpoints, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6930).
- proxmox - old feature flag ``proxmox_default_behavior`` will be removed in community.general 10.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6836).
- redhat module utils - the ``module_utils.redhat`` module is deprecated, as
  effectively unused: the ``Rhsm``, ``RhsmPool``, and ``RhsmPools`` classes
  will be removed in community.general 9.0.0; the ``RegistrationBase`` class
  will be removed in community.general 10.0.0 together with the
  ``rhn_register`` module, as it is the only user of this class; this means
  that the whole ``module_utils.redhat`` module will be dropped in
  community.general 10.0.0, so importing it without even using anything of it
  will fail
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6663).
- redhat_subscription - the ``autosubscribe`` alias for the ``auto_attach`` option has been
  deprecated for many years, although only in the documentation. Officially mark this alias
  as deprecated, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6646).
- redhat_subscription - the ``pool`` option is deprecated in favour of the
  more precise and flexible ``pool_ids`` option
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6650).
- rhsm_repository - ``state=present`` has not been working as expected for many years,
  and it seems it was not noticed so far; also, "presence" is not really a valid concept
  for subscription repositories, which can only be enabled or disabled. Hence, mark the
  ``present`` and ``absent`` values of the ``state`` option as deprecated, slating them
  for removal in community.general 10.0.0
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6673).
- stackdriver - module relies entirely on no longer existent API endpoints, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6887).
