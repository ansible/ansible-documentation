Porting Guide for v8.6.0
========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- ibm.storage_virtualize (version 2.1.0)

Major Changes
-------------

community.mysql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The community.mysql collection no longer supports ``ansible-core 2.12`` and ``ansible-core 2.13``. While we take no active measures to prevent usage and there are no plans to introduce incompatible code to the modules, we will stop testing those versions. Both are or will soon be End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading to the ``latest Ansible / ansible-core 2.15 or later`` as soon as possible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/574).
- mysql_role - the ``column_case_sensitive`` argument's default value will be changed to ``true`` in community.mysql 4.0.0. If your playbook expected the column to be automatically uppercased for your roles privileges, you should set this to false explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/578).
- mysql_user - the ``column_case_sensitive`` argument's default value will be changed to ``true`` in community.mysql 4.0.0. If your playbook expected the column to be automatically uppercased for your users privileges, you should set this to false explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/577).

fortinet.fortios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add new fortios version 7.4.1.
- Format the contents in the changelog.yml file.
- Update Ansible version from 2.9 to 2.14.
- Update Q&A with a resolution for Ansible Always Sending GET/PUT Requests as POST Requests.
- Update the requirement.txt file to specify the sphinx_rtd_theme==1.3.0
- update the required Ansible version to 2.14.0 in the runtime.yml file.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- The collection ``ibm.spectrum_virtualize`` has been renamed to ``ibm.storage_virtualize``. For now, both collections are included in Ansible. The content in ``ibm.spectrum_virtualize`` will be replaced with deprecated redirects to the new collection in Ansible 10.0.0, and these redirects will eventually be removed from Ansible. Please update your FQCNs for ``ibm.spectrum_virtualize``.

Porting Guide for v8.5.0
========================

Deprecated Features
-------------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The next major release, community.general 8.0.0, will drop support for ansible-core 2.11 and 2.12, which have been End of Life for some time now. This means that this collection no longer supports Python 2.6 on the target. Individual content might still work with unsupported ansible-core versions, but that can change at any time. Also please note that from now on, for every new major community.general release, we will drop support for all ansible-core versions that have been End of Life for more than a few weeks on the date of the major release (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/discussions/271, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7259).
- redfish_info, redfish_config, redfish_command - the default value ``10`` for the ``timeout`` option is deprecated and will change to ``60`` in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7295).

Porting Guide for v8.4.0

fortinet.fortios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improve the document for adding notes and examples in Q&A for modules using Integer number as the mkey.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- The ``community.azure`` collection is officially unmaintained and has been archived. Therefore, it will be removed from Ansible 10. There is already a successor collection ``azure.azcollection`` in the community package which should cover the same functionality (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/263).
- The ``hpe.nimble`` collection is considered unmaintained and will be removed from Ansible 10 if no one starts maintaining it again before Ansible 10. See `the removal process for details on how this works <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#cancelling-removal-of-an-unmaintained-collection>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/254).

Ansible-core

- The ngine_io.vultr collection is officially unmaintained and has been archived. Therefore, it will be removed from Ansible 9. There is already a successor collection ``vultr.cloud`` (using the recent v2 Vultr API) in the community package which covers the functionality but might not have compatible syntax (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/257).

community.crypto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Please note that the breaking change announced in the dellemc.enterprise_sonic changelog below is from dellemc.enterprise_sonic 2.1.0 and was reverted in dellemc.enterprise_sonic 2.2.0, so it is not contained in Ansible 8. For technical reasons, this entry is still shown here.

dellemc.enterprise_sonic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- sonic_aaa - Add default_auth attribute to the argspec to replace the deleted group and local attributes. This change allows for ordered login authentication. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/195).

Major Changes
-------------

cloudscale_ch.cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Bump minimum required Ansible version to 2.13.0

Removed Features
----------------

- remove testing for Python 2.6 nad 2.7
- remove testing for ansible 2.9

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- The gluster.gluster collection is considered unmaintained and will be removed from Ansible 10 if no one starts maintaining it again before Ansible 10. See `the removal process for details on how this works <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#cancelling-removal-of-an-unmaintained-collection>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/225).

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- s3_object - support for passing object keys with a leading ``/`` has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2025-12-01 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1549).

community.ciscosmb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- support for Python 2.6 nad 2.7
- support for ansible 2.9

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CmdRunner module utils - deprecate ``cmd_runner_fmt.as_default_type()`` formatter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6601).
- MH VarsMixin module utils - deprecates ``VarsMixin`` and supporting classes in favor of plain ``vardict`` module util (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6649).
- cpanm - value ``compatibility`` is deprecated as default for parameter ``mode`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6512).
- redhat module utils - the ``module_utils.redhat`` module is deprecated, as
  effectively unused: the ``Rhsm``, ``RhsmPool``, and ``RhsmPools`` classes
  will be removed in community.general 9.0.0; the ``RegistrationBase`` class
  will be removed in community.general 10.0.0 together with the
  ``rhn_register`` module, as it is the only user of this class; this means
  that the whole ``module_utils.redhat`` module will be dropped in
  community.general 10.0.0, so importing it without even using anything of it
  will fail
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6663).
- redhat_subscription - the ``autosubscribe`` alias for the ``auto_attach`` option has been
  deprecated for many years, although only in the documentation. Officially mark this alias
  as deprecated, and it will be removed in community.general 9.0.0
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6646).
- redhat_subscription - the ``pool`` option is deprecated in favour of the
  more precise and flexible ``pool_ids`` option
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6650).
- rhsm_repository - ``state=present`` has not been working as expected for many years,
  and it seems it was not noticed so far; also, "presence" is not really a valid concept
  for subscription repositories, which can only be enabled or disabled. Hence, mark the
  ``present`` and ``absent`` values of the ``state`` option as deprecated, slating them
  for removal in community.general 10.0.0
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6673).

========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- dellemc.powerflex (version 1.6.0)
- dellemc.unity (version 1.6.0)
- grafana.grafana (version 2.0.0)
- microsoft.ad (version 1.1.0)
- servicenow.servicenow (version 1.0.6)

Known Issues
------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-test - Additional configuration may be required for certain container host and container combinations. Further details are available in the testing documentation.
- ansible-test - Custom containers with ``VOLUME`` instructions may be unable to start, when previously the containers started correctly. Remove the ``VOLUME`` instructions to resolve the issue. Containers with this condition will cause ``ansible-test`` to emit a warning.
- ansible-test - Systems with Podman networking issues may be unable to run containers, when previously the issue went unreported. Correct the networking issues to continue using ``ansible-test`` with Podman.
- ansible-test - Unit tests for collections do not support ``pytest`` assertion rewriting on Python 2.7.
- ansible-test - Using Docker on systems with SELinux may require setting SELinux to permissive mode. Podman should work with SELinux in enforcing mode.
- dnf5 - The DNF5 package manager currently does not provide all functionality to ensure feature parity between the existing ``dnf`` and the new ``dnf5`` module. As a result the following ``dnf5`` options are effectively a no-op: ``cacheonly``, ``enable_plugin``, ``disable_plugin`` and ``lock_timeout``.

cisco.meraki
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- meraki_network - Updated documentation for `local_status_page_enabled` and `remote_status_page_enabled` as these no longer work.

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The modules and plugins using the vendored code from Docker SDK for Python currently do not work with requests 2.29.0 and/or urllib3 2.0.0. The same is currently true for the latest version of Docker SDK for Python itself (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/611, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/612).
- docker_api connection plugin - does **not work with TCP TLS sockets**! This is caused by the inability to send an ``close_notify`` TLS alert without closing the connection with Python's ``SSLSocket`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/605, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/621).
- docker_container_exec - does **not work with TCP TLS sockets** when the ``stdin`` option is used! This is caused by the inability to send an ``close_notify`` TLS alert without closing the connection with Python's ``SSLSocket`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/605, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/621).

community.routeros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- api_modify - when limits for entries in ``queue tree`` are defined as human readable - for example ``25M`` -, the configuration will be correctly set in ROS, but the module will indicate the item is changed on every run even when there was no change done. This is caused by the ROS API which returns the number in bytes - for example ``25000000`` (which is inconsistent with the CLI behavior). In order to mitigate that, the limits have to be defined in bytes (those will still appear as human readable in the ROS CLI) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).
- api_modify, api_info - ``routing ospf area``, ``routing ospf area range``, ``routing ospf instance``, ``routing ospf interface-template`` paths are not fully implemented for ROS6 due to the significant changes between ROS6 and ROS7 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).

dellemc.openmanage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - Issue(186024) - The module does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name even though it is supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, the existing uplink is modified.

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-doc - no longer treat plugins in collections whose name starts with ``_`` as deprecated (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79362).
- ansible-test - Integration tests which depend on specific file permissions when running in an ansible-test managed host environment may require changes. Tests that require permissions other than ``755`` or ``644`` may need to be updated to set the necessary permissions as part of the test run.
- ansible-test - The ``vcenter`` test plugin now defaults to using a user-provided static configuration instead of the ``govcsim`` simulator for collections. Set the ``ANSIBLE_VCSIM_CONTAINER`` environment variable to ``govcsim`` to use the simulator. Keep in mind that the simulator is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- ansible-test sanity - previously plugins and modules in collections whose name started with ``_`` were treated as deprecated, even when they were not marked as deprecated in ``meta/runtime.yml``. This is no longer the case (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79362).
- ansible-test validate-modules - Removed the ``missing-python-doc`` error code in validate modules, ``missing-documentation`` is used instead for missing PowerShell module documentation.

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.25.0`` and ``boto3<1.22.0``. Most modules will continue to work with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatibility with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1342).
- amazon.aws - compatibility code for Python < 3.6 has been removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1257).
- ec2_eip - the previously deprecated ``instance_id`` alias for the ``device_id`` parameter has been removed. Please use the ``device_id`` parameter name instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/1176).
- ec2_instance - the default value for ``instance_type`` has been removed. At least one of ``instance_type`` or ``launch_template`` must be specified when launching new instances (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1315).
- ec2_vpc_dhcp_options - the ``new_options`` return value has been deprecated after being renamed to ``dhcp_config``.  Please use the ``dhcp_config`` or ``dhcp_options`` return values (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1327).
- ec2_vpc_endpoint - the ``policy_file`` parameter has been removed.  I(policy) with a file lookup can be used instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/1178).
- ec2_vpc_net - the ``classic_link_enabled`` return value has been removed. Support for EC2 Classic networking was dropped by AWS (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1374).
- ec2_vpc_net_info - the ``classic_link_dns_status`` return value has been removed. Support for EC2 Classic networking was dropped by AWS (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1374).
- ec2_vpc_net_info - the ``classic_link_enabled`` return value has been removed. Support for EC2 Classic networking was dropped by AWS (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1374).
- module_utils.cloud - the previously deprecated ``CloudRetry.backoff`` has been removed. Please use ``CloudRetry.exponential_backoff`` or ``CloudRetry.jittered_backoff`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/1110).

ansible.netcommon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- NetworkConnectionBase now inherits from PersistentConnectionBase in ansible.utils. As a result, the minimum ansible.utils version has increased to 2.7.0.
- NetworkTemplate is no longer importable from ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common and should now be found at its proper location ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common.rm_base.network_template
- ResourceModule is no longer importable from ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common and should now be found at its proper location ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common.rm_base.resource_module
- VALID_MASKS, is_masklen, is_netmask, to_bits, to_ipv6_network, to_masklen, to_netmask, and to_subnet are no longer importable from ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common.utils and should now be found at their proper location ansible.module_utils.common.network

community.aws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The community.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.25.0`` and ``boto3<1.22.0``. Most modules will continue to work with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatability with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1743).
- aws_ssm - the AWS SSM plugin was incorrectly prepending ``sudo`` to most commands.  This behaviour was incorrect and has been removed. To execute commands as a specific user, including the ``root`` user, the ``become`` and ``become_user`` directives should be used.  See the `Ansible documentation for more information <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_privilege_escalation.html>`_ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/853).
- codebuild_project - ``tags`` parameter now accepts a dict representing the tags, rather than the boto3 format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1643).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If you are not using this collection as part of Ansible, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.sap_libs`` if you are using any of the ``sapcar_extract``, ``sap_task_list_execute``, and ``hana_query`` modules.
  Without that collection installed, the redirects for these modules do not work.
- ModuleHelper module utils - when the module sets output variables named ``msg``, ``exception``, ``output``, ``vars``, or ``changed``, the actual output will prefix those names with ``_`` (underscore symbol) only when they clash with output variables generated by ModuleHelper itself, which only occurs when handling exceptions. Please note that this breaking change does not require a new major release since before this release, it was not possible to add such variables to the output `due to a bug <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5755>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5765).
- gconftool2 - fix processing of ``gconftool-2`` when ``key`` does not exist, returning ``null`` instead of empty string for both ``value`` and ``previous_value`` return values (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/6028).
- gitlab_runner - the default of ``access_level_on_creation`` changed from ``false`` to ``true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6428).
- ldap_search - convert all string-like values to UTF-8 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/5704, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6473).
- nmcli - the default of the ``hairpin`` option changed from ``true`` to ``false`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6428).
- proxmox - the default of the ``unprivileged`` option changed from ``false`` to ``true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6428).

community.hashi_vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for ``ansible-core`` 2.11 and 2.12 has been removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/340).
- The minimum version of ``hvac`` for ``community.hashi_vault`` is now ``1.1.0`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/324).
- hashi_vault lookup - duplicate option entries in the term string now raises an exception instead of a warning (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/356).

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~
