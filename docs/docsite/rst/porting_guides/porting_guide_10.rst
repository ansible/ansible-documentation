Ansible 10 Porting Guide
========================

.. contents::
  :depth: 2


Ansible 10 is based on Ansible-core 2.17.

We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible 10 Changelog <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/10/CHANGELOG-v10.md>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

Playbook
========

* Conditionals - due to mitigation of security issue CVE-2023-5764 in ansible-core 2.16.1,
  conditional expressions with embedded template blocks can fail with the message
  "``Conditional is marked as unsafe, and cannot be evaluated.``" when an embedded template
  consults data from untrusted sources like module results or vars marked ``!unsafe``.
  Conditionals with embedded templates can be a source of malicious template injection when
  referencing untrusted data, and can nearly always be rewritten without embedded
  templates. Playbook task conditional keywords such as ``when`` and ``until`` have long
  displayed warnings discouraging use of embedded templates in conditionals; this warning
  has been expanded to non-task conditionals as well, such as the ``assert`` action.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     - name: task with a module result (always untrusted by Ansible)
       shell: echo "hi mom"
       register: untrusted_result

     # don't do it this way...
     # - name: insecure conditional with embedded template consulting untrusted data
     #   assert:
     #     that: '"hi mom" is in {{ untrusted_result.stdout }}'

     - name: securely access untrusted values directly as Jinja variables instead
       assert:
         that: '"hi mom" is in untrusted_result.stdout'

Porting Guide for v10.0.0
=========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- community.library_inventory_filtering_v1 (version 1.0.1)
- kaytus.ksmanage (version 1.2.1)

Known Issues
------------

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Please note that the fix for requests 2.32.0 included in community.docker 3.10.1 only
  fixes problems with the *vendored* Docker SDK for Python code. Modules and plugins that
  use Docker SDK for Python can still fail due to the SDK currently being incompatible
  with requests 2.32.0.

  If you still experience problems with requests 2.32.0, such as error messages like
  ``Not supported URL scheme http+docker``, please restrict requests to ``<2.32.0``.

dellemc.openmanage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- idrac_diagnostics - Issue(285322) - This module doesn't support export of diagnostics file to HTTP and HTTPS share via SOCKS proxy.
- idrac_firmware - Issue(279282) - This module does not support firmware update using HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP shares with authentication on iDRAC8.
- idrac_network_attributes - Issue(279049) -  If unsupported values are provided for the parameter ``ome_network_attributes``, then this module does not provide a correct error message.
- idrac_storage_volume - Issue(290766) - The module will report success instead of showing failure for new virtual creation on the BOSS-N1 controller if a virtual disk is already present on the same controller.
- ome_device_network_services - Issue(212681) - The module does not provide a proper error message if unsupported values are provided for the following parameters- port_number, community_name, max_sessions, max_auth_retries, and idle_timeout.
- ome_device_power_settings - Issue(212679) - The module displays the following message if the value provided for the parameter ``power_cap`` is not within the supported range of 0 to 32767, ``Unable to complete the request because PowerCap does not exist or is not applicable for the resource URI.``
- ome_device_quick_deploy - Issue(275231) - This module does not deploy a new configuration to a slot that has disabled IPv6.
- ome_diagnostics - Issue(279193) - Export of SupportAssist collection logs to the share location fails on OME version 4.0.0.
- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - Issue(186024) - The module supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular, however it does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, then the existing uplink is modified.

If you use the Ansible community package, both collections are included and you do not have to do anything special. If you install the collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed automatically. If you install the collection by copying the files of the collection to a place where ansible-core can find it, for example by cloning the git repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install the dependency if you are using the inventory plugins (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/196).

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``community.docker`` collection now depends on the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1`` collection. This utility collection provides host filtering functionality for inventory plugins. If you use the Ansible community package, both collections are included and you do not have to do anything special. If you install the collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed automatically. If you install the collection by copying the files of the collection to a place where ansible-core can find it, for example by cloning the git repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install the dependency if you are using the inventory plugins (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/698).

community.hashi_vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- requirements - the ``requests`` package which is required by ``hvac`` now has a more restrictive range for this collection in certain use cases due to breaking security changes in ``ansible-core`` that were backported (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/pull/416).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The deprecated redirects for internal module names have been removed. These internal redirects were extra-long FQCNs like ``community.general.packaging.os.apt_rpm`` that redirect to the short FQCN ``community.general.apt_rpm``. They were originally needed to implement flatmapping; as various tooling started to recommend users to use the long names flatmapping was removed from the collection and redirects were added for users who already followed these incorrect recommendations (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7835).
- ansible_galaxy_install - the ``ack_ansible29`` and ``ack_min_ansiblecore211`` options have been removed. They no longer had any effect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/8198).

- flowdock - this module relied on HTTPS APIs that do not exist anymore and was thus removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/8198).
- mh.mixins.deps module utils - the ``DependencyMixin`` has been removed. Use the ``deps`` module utils instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/8198).

community.grafana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- removed deprecated `message` argument in `grafana_dashboard`

community.hrobot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The collection no longer supports Ansible, ansible-base, and ansible-core releases that are currently End of Life at the time of the 2.0.0 release. This means that Ansible 2.9, ansible-base 2.10, ansible-core 2.11, ansible-core 2.12, ansible-core 2.13, and ansible-core 2.14 are no longer supported. The collection might still work with these versions, but it can stop working at any moment without advance notice, and this will not be considered a bug (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).

junipernetworks.junos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove deprected junos_logging module which is replaced by junos_logging_global resource module.

-------------------

- The ``inspur.sm`` collection is considered unmaintained and will be removed from Ansible 11 if no one starts maintaining it again before Ansible 11. See `the removal process for details on how this works <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#cancelling-removal-of-an-unmaintained-collection>`__ (https://forum.ansible.com/t/2854).

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

community.crypto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- acme documentation fragment - the default ``community.crypto.acme[.documentation]`` docs fragment is deprecated and will be removed from community.crypto 3.0.0. Replace it with both the new ``community.crypto.acme.basic`` and ``community.crypto.acme.account`` fragments (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/735).
- acme.backends module utils - from community.crypto on, all implementations of ``CryptoBackend`` must override ``get_ordered_csr_identifiers()``. The current default implementation, which simply sorts the result of ``get_csr_identifiers()``, will then be removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/725).
- acme.backends module utils - the ``get_cert_information()`` method for a ACME crypto backend must be implemented from community.crypto 3.0.0 on (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/736).
- crypto.module_backends.common module utils - the ``crypto.module_backends.common`` module utils is deprecated and will be removed from community.crypto 3.0.0. Use the improved ``argspec`` module util instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/749).
- openssl_csr_pipe, openssl_privatekey_pipe, x509_certificate_pipe - the current behavior of check mode is deprecated and will change in community.crypto 3.0.0. The current behavior is similar to the modules without ``_pipe``: if the object needs to be (re-)generated, only the ``changed`` status is set, but the object is not updated. From community.crypto 3.0.0 on, the modules will ignore check mode and always act as if check mode is not active. This behavior can already achieved now by adding ``check_mode: false`` to the task. If you think this breaks your use-case of this module, please `create an issue in the community.crypto repository <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/new/choose>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/712, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/714).

community.dns

- hetzner_dns_records and hosttech_dns_records inventory plugins - the ``filters`` option has been renamed to ``simple_filters``. The old name will stop working in community.hrobot 2.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/181).

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_compose - the Docker Compose v1 module is deprecated and will be removed from community.docker 4.0.0. Please migrate to the ``community.docker.docker_compose_v2`` module, which works with Docker Compose v2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/823, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/833).
- docker_container - the default ``ignore`` for the ``image_name_mismatch`` parameter has been deprecated and will switch to ``recreate`` in community.docker 4.0.0. A deprecation warning will be printed in situations where the default value is used and where a behavior would change once the default changes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/703).
- various modules and plugins - the ``ssl_version`` option has been deprecated and will be removed from community.docker 4.0.0. It has already been removed from Docker SDK for Python 7.0.0, and was only necessary in the past to work around SSL/TLS issues (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/853).

- ModuleHelper vars module_utils - bump deprecation of ``VarMeta``, ``VarDict`` and ``VarsMixin`` to version 11.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/8226).
- apt_rpm - the behavior of ``state=present`` and ``state=installed`` is deprecated and will change in community.general 11.0.0. Right now the module will upgrade a package to the latest version if one of these two states is used. You should explicitly use ``state=latest`` if you want this behavior, and switch to ``state=present_not_latest`` if you do not want to upgrade the package if it is already installed. In community.general 11.0.0 the behavior of ``state=present`` and ``state=installed`` will change to that of ``state=present_not_latest`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/8217, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/8285).

- hipchat callback plugin - the hipchat service has been discontinued and the self-hosted variant has been End of Life since 2020. The callback plugin is therefore deprecated and will be removed from community.general 10.0.0 if nobody provides compelling reasons to still keep it (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/8184, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/8189).
- irc - the defaults ``false`` for ``use_tls`` and ``validate_certs`` have been deprecated and will change to ``true`` in community.general 10.0.0 to improve security. You can already improve security now by explicitly setting them to ``true``. Specifying values now disables the deprecation warning (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7578).
