Ansible 7 Porting Guide
=======================

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 2


Ansible 7 is based on Ansible-core 2.14.


We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible 7 Changelog <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/7/CHANGELOG-v7.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.


Playbook
========

* Variables are now evaluated lazily; only when they are actually used. For example, in ansible-core 2.14 an expression ``{{ defined_variable or undefined_variable }}`` does not fail on ``undefined_variable`` if the first part of ``or`` is evaluated to ``True`` as it is not needed to evaluate the second part. One particular case of a change in behavior to note is the task below which uses the ``undefined`` test. Prior to version 2.14 this would result in a fatal error trying to access the undefined value in the dictionary. In 2.14 the assertion passes as the dictionary is evaluated as undefined through one of its undefined values:

 .. code-block:: yaml

     - assert:
         that:
           - some_defined_dict_with_undefined_values is undefined
       vars:
         dict_value: 1
         some_defined_dict_with_undefined_values:
           key1: value1
           key2: '{{ dict_value }}'
           key3: '{{ undefined_dict_value }}'


Command Line
============

* Python 3.9 on the controller node is a hard requirement for this release. 
* At startup the filesystem encoding and locale are checked to verify they are UTF-8. If not, the process exits with an error reporting the errant encoding. If you were previously using the ``C`` or ``POSIX`` locale, you may be able to use ``C.UTF-8``. If you were previously using a locale such as ``en_US.ISO-8859-1``, you may be able to use ``en_US.UTF-8``. For simplicity it may be easiest to export the appropriate locale using the ``LC_ALL`` environment variable. An alternative to modifying your system locale is to run Python in UTF-8 mode; See the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONUTF8>`_ for more information.

Porting Guide for v7.6.0
========================

Known Issues
------------

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The modules and plugins using the vendored code from Docker SDK for Python currently do not work with requests 2.29.0 and/or urllib3 2.0.0. The same is currently true for the latest version of Docker SDK for Python itself (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/611, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/612).
- docker_api connection plugin - does **not work with TCP TLS sockets**! This is caused by the inability to send an ``close_notify`` TLS alert without closing the connection with Python's ``SSLSocket`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/605, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/621).
- docker_container_exec - does **not work with TCP TLS sockets** when the ``stdin`` option is used! This is caused by the inability to send an ``close_notify`` TLS alert without closing the connection with Python's ``SSLSocket`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/605, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/621).

Major Changes
-------------

community.postgresql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- postgresql_privs - the ``password`` argument is deprecated and will be removed in community.postgresql 4.0.0, use the ``login_password`` argument instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/issues/406).

- Added NIOS Range module with Create, Update and Delete features `#152 <https://github.com/infobloxopen/infoblox-ansible/pull/152>`_
- Fixes issue unable to update/delete EAs using Ansible plugin `#180 <https://github.com/infobloxopen/infoblox-ansible/pull/180>`_
- Fixes static and dynamic allocation of IPV4 address of A Record `#182 <https://github.com/infobloxopen/infoblox-ansible/pull/182>`_
- Fixes to Update host name of  NIOS member `#176 <https://github.com/infobloxopen/infoblox-ansible/pull/176>`_
- Updates default WAPI version to 2.9 `#176 <https://github.com/infobloxopen/infoblox-ansible/pull/176>`_

Deprecated Features
-------------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- x509_crl - the ``mode`` option is deprecated; use ``crl_mode`` instead. The ``mode`` option will change its meaning in community.crypto 3.0.0, and will refer to the CRL file's mode instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/596).

Porting Guide for v7.5.0
========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- microsoft.ad (version 1.0.0)

Deprecated Features
-------------------

cisco.ios
~~~~~~~~~

- ios_bgp_address_family - deprecate redistribute.ospf.match.external with redistribute.ospf.match.externals which enables attributes for OSPF type E1 and E2 routes
- ios_bgp_address_family - deprecate redistribute.ospf.match.nssa_external with redistribute.ospf.match.nssa_externals which enables attributes for OSPF type N1 and N2 routes

Porting Guide for v7.4.0
========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-test - Integration tests which depend on specific file permissions when running in an ansible-test managed host environment may require changes. Tests that require permissions other than ``755`` or ``644`` may need to be updated to set the necessary permissions as part of the test run.

Major Changes
-------------

community.hrobot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- firewall - Hetzner added output rules support to the firewall. This change unfortunately means that using old versions of the firewall module will always set the output rule list to empty, thus disallowing the server to send out packets (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/75, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/76).

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use true/false (lowercase) for boolean values in documentation and examples (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/issues/1660).

fortinet.fortios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add annotations of member operation for every module.
- Update ``fortios.py`` for higher performance;
- supports temporary session key and pre/post login banner;
- update the examples on how to use member operation in Q&A.

purestorage.fusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Patching of resource properties was brought to parity with underlying Python SDK
- fusion_volume - fixed and reorganized, arguments changed

Deprecated Features
-------------------

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- support for passing both profile and security tokens through a mix of environment variables and parameters has been deprecated and support will be removed in release 6.0.0. After release 6.0.0 it will only be possible to pass either a profile or security tokens, regardless of mechanism used to pass them.  To explicitly block a parameter coming from an environment variable pass an empty string as the parameter value.  Support for passing profile and security tokens together was originally deprecated in release 1.2.0, however only partially implemented in release 5.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1355).

community.aws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ecs_service -  In a release after 2024-06-01, tha default value of ``purge_placement_constraints`` will be change from ``false`` to ``true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1716).
- ecs_service -  In a release after 2024-06-01, tha default value of ``purge_placement_strategy`` will be change from ``false`` to ``true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1716).
- iam_role - All top level return values other than ``iam_role`` and ``changed`` have been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2023-12-01 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/551).
- iam_role - In a release after 2023-12-01 the contents of ``assume_role_policy_document`` will no longer be converted from CamelCase to snake_case.  The ``assume_role_policy_document_raw`` return value already returns the policy document in this future format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/551).
- iam_role_info - In a release after 2023-12-01 the contents of ``assume_role_policy_document`` will no longer be converted from CamelCase to snake_case.  The ``assume_role_policy_document_raw`` return value already returns the policy document in this future format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/551).

community.hashi_vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- hashi_vault lookup - in ``v5.0.0`` duplicate term string options will raise an exception instead of showing a warning (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/356).

purestorage.fusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- fusion_hw - hardware module is being removed as changing hardware type has never been supported by Pure Storage Fusion
- fusion_info - nigs subset is deprecated in favor of network_interface_groups and will be removed in the version 1.7.0
- fusion_info - placements subset is deprecated in favor of placement_groups and will be removed in the version 1.7.0
- fusion_pg - placement_engine option is deprecated because Fusion API does not longer support this parameter It will be removed in the version 2.0.0
- fusion_se - parameters 'addresses', 'gateway' and 'network_interface_groups' are deprecated in favor of 'iscsi' and will be removed in version 2.0.0
- fusion_tn - tenant networks are being replaced by storage endpoints ```fusion_se``` and Network Interface Groups ```fusion_nig```

Porting Guide for v7.3.0
========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

hetzner.hcloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- inventory plugin - Python v3.5+ is now required.

Major Changes
-------------

kubernetes.core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- refactor K8sAnsibleMixin into module_utils/k8s/ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/kubernetes.core/pull/481).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- Since the google.cloud collection seems to be maintained again, we `cancelled the removal process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#cancelling-removal-of-an-unmaintained-collection>`__. So contrary to an earlier announcement, this collection is NOT deprecated and will NOT be removed from Ansible 8 (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/105).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- gitlab_runner - the option ``access_level`` will lose its default value in community.general 8.0.0. From that version on, you have set this option to ``ref_protected`` explicitly, if you want to have a protected runner (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/5925).

Porting Guide for v7.2.0
========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- dellemc.powerflex (version 1.5.0)
- dellemc.unity (version 1.5.0)

Known Issues
------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-test - Additional configuration may be required for certain container host and container combinations. Further details are available in the testing documentation.
- ansible-test - Custom containers with ``VOLUME`` instructions may be unable to start, when previously the containers started correctly. Remove the ``VOLUME`` instructions to resolve the issue. Containers with this condition will cause ``ansible-test`` to emit a warning.
- ansible-test - Systems with Podman networking issues may be unable to run containers, when previously the issue went unreported. Correct the networking issues to continue using ``ansible-test`` with Podman.
- ansible-test - Using Docker on systems with SELinux may require setting SELinux to permissive mode. Podman should work with SELinux in enforcing mode.

cisco.meraki
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- meraki_network - Updated documentation for `local_status_page_enabled` and `remote_status_page_enabled` as these no longer work.

Breaking Changes
----------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ModuleHelper module utils - when the module sets output variables named ``msg``, ``exception``, ``output``, ``vars``, or ``changed``, the actual output will prefix those names with ``_`` (underscore symbol) only when they clash with output variables generated by ModuleHelper itself, which only occurs when handling exceptions. Please note that this breaking change does not require a new major release since before this release, it was not possible to add such variables to the output `due to a bug <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5755>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5765).

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-test - Docker Desktop on WSL2 is now supported (additional configuration required).
- ansible-test - Docker and Podman are now supported on hosts with cgroup v2 unified. Previously only cgroup v1 and cgroup v2 hybrid were supported.
- ansible-test - Podman now works on container hosts without systemd. Previously only some containers worked, while others required rootfull or rootless Podman, but would not work with both. Some containers did not work at all.
- ansible-test - Podman on WSL2 is now supported.
- ansible-test - When additional cgroup setup is required on the container host, this will be automatically detected. Instructions on how to configure the host will be provided in the error message shown.

ansible.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Set the minimum Ansible version supported by this collection to Ansible 2.12

chocolatey.chocolatey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- win_chocolatey - Allow users to select the TLS versions used for bootstrapping Chocolatey installation.

community.hashi_vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-core - support for ``ansible-core`` versions ``2.11`` and ``2.12`` will be dropped in collection version ``5.0.0``, making ``2.13`` the minimum supported version of ``ansible-core`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/340).
- hvac - the minimum version of ``hvac`` to be supported in collection version ``5.0.0`` will be at least ``1.0.2``; this minimum may be raised before ``5.0.0`` is released, so please subscribe to the linked issue and look out for new notices in the changelog (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/324).

Porting Guide for v7.1.0
========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- grafana.grafana (version 1.1.0)

Known Issues
------------

community.routeros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- api_modify - when limits for entries in ``queue tree`` are defined as human readable - for example ``25M`` -, the configuration will be correctly set in ROS, but the module will indicate the item is changed on every run even when there was no change done. This is caused by the ROS API which returns the number in bytes - for example ``25000000`` (which is inconsistent with the CLI behavior). In order to mitigate that, the limits have to be defined in bytes (those will still appear as human readable in the ROS CLI) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).
- api_modify, api_info - ``routing ospf area``, ``routing ospf area range``, ``routing ospf instance``, ``routing ospf interface-template`` paths are not fully implemeted for ROS6 due to the significat changes between ROS6 and ROS7 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).

Major Changes
-------------

cisco.meraki
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- meraki_mr_l7_firewall - New module
- meraki_webhook_payload_template - New module

Porting Guide for v7.0.0
========================

Added Collections
-----------------

Known Issues
------------

community.routeros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``community.routeros.command`` module claims to support check mode. Since it cannot judge whether the commands executed modify state or not, this behavior is incorrect. Since this potentially breaks existing playbooks, we will not change this behavior until community.routeros 3.0.0.

dellemc.openmanage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- idrac_user - Issue(192043) The module may error out with the message ``unable to perform the import or export operation because there are pending attribute changes or a configuration job is in progress``. Wait for the job to complete and run the task again.

- ome_device_local_access_configuration - Issue(215035) - The module reports ``Successfully updated the local access setting`` if an unsupported value is provided for the parameter timeout_limit. However, this value is not actually applied on OpenManage Enterprise Modular.
- ome_device_local_access_configuration - Issue(217865) - The module does not display a proper error message if an unsupported value is provided for the user_defined and lcd_language parameters.
- ome_device_network_services - Issue(212681) - The module does not provide a proper error message if unsupported values are provided for the parameters- port_number, community_name, max_sessions, max_auth_retries, and idle_timeout.
- ome_device_power_settings - Issue(212679) - The module displays the following message if the value provided for the parameter ``power_cap`` is not within the supported range of 0 to 32767, ``Unable to complete the request because PowerCap does not exist or is not applicable for the resource URI.``
- ome_device_quick_deploy - Issue(216352) - The module does not display a proper error message if an unsupported value is provided for the ipv6_prefix_length and vlan_id parameters.
- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - Issue(186024) - The module does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name even though it is supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, the existing uplink is modified.

netapp.ontap
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- na_ontap_snapshot - added documentation to use UTC format for ``expiry_time``.

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Ansible 7 requires Python 3.9 on the controller, same as ansible-core 2.14.

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Allow for lazy evaluation of Jinja2 expressions (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/56017)
- The default ansible-galaxy role skeletons no longer contain .travis.yml files. You can configure ansible-galaxy to use a custom role skeleton that contains a .travis.yml file to continue using Galaxy's integration with Travis CI.
- ansible - At startup the filesystem encoding and locale are checked to verify they are UTF-8. If not, the process exits with an error reporting the errant encoding.
- ansible - Increase minimum Python requirement to Python 3.9 for CLI utilities and controller code
- ansible-test - At startup the filesystem encoding is checked to verify it is UTF-8. If not, the process exits with an error reporting the errant encoding.
- ansible-test - At startup the locale is configured as ``en_US.UTF-8``, with a fallback to ``C.UTF-8``. If neither encoding is available the process exits with an error. If the fallback is used, a warning is displayed. In previous versions the ``en_US.UTF-8`` locale was always requested. However, no startup checking was performed to verify the locale was successfully configured.
- ansible-test validate-modules - Removed the ``missing-python-doc`` error code in validate modules, ``missing-documentation`` is used instead for missing PowerShell module documentation.
- strategy plugins - Make ``ignore_unreachable`` to increase ``ignored`` and ``ok`` and  counter, not ``skipped`` and ``unreachable``. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77690)

- route53_health_check - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.route53_health_check``.
- route53_health_check - the previously deprecated default value of ``purge_tags=False`` has been updated to ``purge_tags=True`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1343).
- route53_info - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.route53_info``.

- script_inventory_ec2 - The ec2.py inventory script has been moved to a new repository. The script can now be downloaded from https://github.com/ansible-community/contrib-scripts/blob/main/inventory/ec2.py and has been removed from this collection. We recommend migrating from the script to the amazon.aws.ec2 inventory plugin.  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/898)
- sqs_queue - the previously deprecated default value of ``purge_tags=False`` has been updated to ``purge_tags=True`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1343).

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This collection does not work with ansible-core 2.11 on Python 3.12+. Please either upgrade to ansible-core 2.12+, or use Python 3.11 or earlier (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/271).
- docker_container - ``exposed_ports`` is no longer ignored in ``comparisons``. Before, its value was assumed to be identical with the value of ``published_ports`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
- docker_container - ``log_options`` can no longer be specified when ``log_driver`` is not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
- docker_container - ``publish_all_ports`` is no longer ignored in ``comparisons`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
- docker_container - ``restart_retries`` can no longer be specified when ``restart_policy`` is not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
- docker_container - ``stop_timeout`` is no longer ignored for idempotency if told to be not ignored in ``comparisons``. So far it defaulted to ``ignore`` there, and setting it to ``strict`` had no effect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
- modules and plugins communicating directly with the Docker daemon - when connecting by SSH and not using ``use_ssh_client=true``, reject unknown host keys instead of accepting them. This is only a breaking change relative to older community.docker 3.0.0 pre-releases or with respect to Docker SDK for Python < 6.0.0. Docker SDK for Python 6.0.0 will also include this change (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/434).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- newrelic_deployment - ``revision`` is required for v2 API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5341).
- scaleway_container_registry_info - no longer replace ``secret_environment_variables`` in the output by ``SENSITIVE_VALUE`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5497).

community.hashi_vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- auth - the default value for ``token_validate`` has changed from ``true`` to ``false``, as previously announced (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/248).
- vault_kv2_get lookup - as previously announced, the default value for ``engine_mount_point`` in the ``vault_kv2_get`` lookup has changed from ``kv`` to ``secret`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/279).

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed support for ansible-core version < 2.13.0.
- vmware_dvs_portgroup - Add a new sub-option `inherited` to the `in_traffic_shaping` parameter. This means you can keep the setting as-is by not defining the parameter, but also that you have to define the setting as not `inherited` if you want to override it at the PG level (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/pull/1483).
- vmware_dvs_portgroup - Add a new sub-option `inherited` to the `out_traffic_shaping` parameter. This means you can keep the setting as-is by not defining the parameter, but also that you have to define the setting as not `inherited` if you want to override it at the PG level (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/pull/1483).
- vmware_dvs_portgroup - Change the type of `net_flow` to string to allow setting it implicitly to inherited or to keep the value as-is. This means you can keep the setting as-is by not defining the parameter, but also that while `true` or `no` still work, `True` or `Off` (uppercase) won't (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/pull/1483).
- vmware_dvs_portgroup - Remove support for vSphere API less than 6.7.
- vmware_dvs_portgroup - Remove the default for `network_policy` and add a new sub-option `inherited`. This means you can keep the setting as-is by not defining the parameter, but also that you have to define the setting as not `inherited` if you want to override it at the PG level (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/pull/1483).
- vmware_dvs_portgroup_info - Remove support for vSphere API less than 6.7.
- vmware_dvswitch - Remove support for vSphere API less than 6.7.
- vmware_dvswitch_uplink_pg - Remove support for vSphere API less than 6.7.
- vmware_guest_boot_manager - Remove default for ``secure_boot_enabled`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/issues/1461).
- vmware_vm_config_option - Dict item names in result are changed from strings joined with spaces to strings joined with underlines, e.g. `Guest fullname` is changed to `guest_fullname` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/issues/1268).
- vmware_vspan_session - Remove support for vSphere API less than 6.7.

dellemc.enterprise_sonic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- bgp_af - Add the route_advertise_list dictionary to the argspec to replace the deleted, obsolete advertise_prefix attribute used for SONiC 3.x images on the 1.x branch of this collection. This change corresponds to a SONiC 4.0 OC YANG REST compliance change for the BGP AF REST API. It enables specification of a route map in conjunction with each route advertisement prefix (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/63).
- bgp_af - remove the obsolete 'advertise_prefix' attribute from argspec and config code. This and subsequent co-req replacement with the new route advertise list argument structure require corresponding changes in playbooks previoulsly used for configuring route advertise prefixes for SONiC 3.x images. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/60)
- bgp_neighbors - Replace the previously defined standalone "bfd" attribute with a bfd dictionary containing multiple attributes. This change corresponds to the revised SONiC 4.x implementation of OC YANG compatible REST APIs. Playbooks previously using the bfd attributes for SONiC 3.x images must be modified for useon SONiC 4.0 images to use the new definition for the bfd attribute argspec structure (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/72).
- bgp_neighbors - Replace, for BGP peer groups, the previously defined standalone "bfd" attribute with a bfd dictionary containing multiple attributes. This change corresponds to the revised SONiC 4.x implementation of OC YANG compatible REST APIs. Playbooks previously using the bfd attributes for SONiC 3.x images must be modified for useon SONiC 4.0 images to use the new definition for the bfd attribute argspec structure (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/81).

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Move handler processing into new ``PlayIterator`` phase to use the configured strategy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65067)
- ansible - At startup the filesystem encoding and locale are checked to verify they are UTF-8. If not, the process exits with an error reporting the errant encoding.
- ansible - Increase minimum Python requirement to Python 3.9 for CLI utilities and controller code
- ansible-test - At startup the filesystem encoding is checked to verify it is UTF-8. If not, the process exits with an error reporting the errant encoding.
- ansible-test - At startup the locale is configured as ``en_US.UTF-8``, with a fallback to ``C.UTF-8``. If neither encoding is available the process exits with an error. If the fallback is used, a warning is displayed. In previous versions the ``en_US.UTF-8`` locale was always requested. However, no startup checking was performed to verify the locale was successfully configured.

community.aws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- community.aws collection - The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.20.0`` and ``boto3<1.17.0``. Most modules will continue to work with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatibility with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/956).

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The collection now contains vendored code from the Docker SDK for Python to talk to the Docker daemon. Modules and plugins using this code no longer need the Docker SDK for Python installed on the machine the module or plugin is running on (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/398).
- docker_api connection plugin - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/414).
- docker_container - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
- docker_container - the module was completely rewritten from scratch (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).

- docker_image_load - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/406).
- docker_login - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/407).

If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/412).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The internal structure of the collection was changed for modules and action plugins. These no longer live in a directory hierarchy ordered by topic, but instead are now all in a single (flat) directory. This has no impact on users *assuming they did not use internal FQCNs*. These will still work, but result in deprecation warnings. They were never officially supported and thus the redirects are kept as a courtsey, and this is not labelled as a breaking change. Note that for example the Ansible VScode plugin started recommending these internal names. If you followed its recommendation, you will now have to change back to the short names to avoid deprecation warnings, and potential errors in the future as these redirects will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5461).
- newrelic_deployment - removed New Relic v1 API, added support for v2 API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5341).

community.mysql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- mysql_db - the ``pipefail`` argument's default value will be changed to ``true`` in community.mysql 4.0.0. If your target machines do not use ``bash`` as a default interpreter, set ``pipefail`` to ``false`` explicitly. However, we strongly recommend setting up ``bash`` as a default and ``pipefail=true`` as it will protect you from getting broken dumps you don't know about (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/407).

community.network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The community.network collection no longer supports Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10. While we take no active measures to prevent usage, we will remove compatibility code and other compatility measures that will effectively prevent using most content from this collection with Ansible 2.9, and some content of this collection with ansible-base 2.10. Both Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 will very soon be End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading to ansible-core 2.11 or later as soon as possible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/426).
- The internal structure of the collection was changed for modules and action plugins. These no longer live in a directory hierarchy ordered by topic, but instead are now all in a single (flat) directory. This has no impact on users *assuming they did not use internal FQCNs*. These will still work, but result in deprecation warnings. They were never officially supported and thus the redirects are kept as a courtsey, and this is not labelled as a breaking change. Note that for example the Ansible VScode plugin started recommending these internal names. If you followed its recommendation, you will now have to change back to the short names to avoid deprecation warnings, and potential errors in the future as these redirects will be removed in community.network 8.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/482).

community.postgresql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- postgresql_user - the ``groups`` argument has been deprecated and will be removed in ``community.postgresql 3.0.0``. Please use the ``postgresql_membership`` module to specify group/role memberships instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/issues/277).

dellemc.enterprise_sonic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added 'static_routes' module to collection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/82).
- Added a resource module for NTP support (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/99).
- Added a resource module for support of prefix lists (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/100).
- Updated backend REST API request formats in all applicable modules for compatibility with SONiC 4.x openconfig YANG compliant REST APIs. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/53)

dellemc.openmanage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added collection metadata for creating execution environments.
- Refactored the Markdown (MD) files and content for better readability.
- The share parameters are deprecated from the following modules - idrac_network, idrac_timezone_ntp, dellemc_configure_idrac_eventing, dellemc_configure_idrac_services, dellemc_idrac_lc_attributes, dellemc_system_lockdown_mode.
- idrac_bios - The module is enhanced to support clear pending BIOS attributes, reset BIOS to default settings, and configure BIOS attribute using Redfish.
- idrac_boot - Support for configuring the boot settings on iDRAC.
