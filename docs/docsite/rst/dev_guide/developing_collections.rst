Developing collections
**********************

Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content. You can package and distribute playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins using collections. A typical collection addresses a set of related use cases. For example, the ``cisco.ios`` collection automates management of Cisco IOS devices.

You can create a collection and publish it to `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_ or to a private Automation Hub instance. You can publish certified collections to the Red Hat Automation Hub, part of the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

Examine the :ref:`developing_collections_path` to understand how to go from creating a collection to having it included in the Ansible package distribution.
