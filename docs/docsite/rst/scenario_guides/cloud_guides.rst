Legacy Public Cloud Guides
**************************

The legacy guides in this section may be out of date. They cover using Ansible with a range of public cloud platforms. They explore particular use cases in greater depth and provide a more "top-down" explanation of some basic features.

Guides for using public clouds are moving into collections. We are migrating these guides into collections. Please update your links for the following guides:
