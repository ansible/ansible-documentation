Introduction
============

This section shows you how to use Ansible to create a virtual machine.

Scenario requirements
=====================

You've already followed :ref:`vmware_rest_collect_info` and you've got the following variables defined:

- ``my_cluster_info``
- ``my_datastore``
- ``my_virtual_machine_folder``
- ``my_cluster_info``

How to create a virtual machine
===============================

In this example, we will use the ``vcenter_vm`` module to create a new guest.

.. literalinclude:: task_outputs/Create_a_VM.task.yaml

Result
______

.. literalinclude:: task_outputs/Create_a_VM.result.json

.. note::
    ``vcenter_vm`` accepts more parameters, however you may prefer to start with a simple VM and use the ``vcenter_vm_hardware`` modules to tune it up afterwards. It is easier this way to identify a potential problematical step.
