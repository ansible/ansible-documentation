Installing Ansible on specific operating systems
================================================

.. note:: These instructions are provided by their respective communities. Any bugs/issues should be filed with that community to update these instructions. Ansible maintains only the ``pip install`` instructions.

The ``ansible`` package can always be :ref:`installed from PyPI using pip <intro_installation_guide>` on most systems but it is also packaged and maintained by the community for a variety of Linux distributions.

The following instructions will guide you through installing the ``ansible`` package with your preferred distribution's package manager.

.. note:: For maintainers who wish to add distributions to this guide, installation instructions are included here only for distributions with a reasonably up-to-date version of ``ansible``. The distribution MUST ensure that ``ansible-core`` and ``ansible`` versions are kept in sync to the extent that the distribution build system allows. Maintainers MUST include a way to contact them with their instructions here and are encouraged to join the `Ansible Packaging <https://matrix.to/#/#packaging:ansible.com>`_ Matrix room.

Installing Ansible on Fedora Linux
-------------------------------------------------

To install the batteries included ``ansible`` package on Fedora run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dnf install ansible

If you prefer to install the minimal ``ansible-core`` package run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dnf install ansible-core

Several Ansible collections are also available from the Fedora repositories as
standalone packages that users can install alongside ``ansible-core``.
For example, to install the ``community.general`` collection run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo dnf install ansible-collection-community-general

See the `Fedora Packages index <https://packages.fedoraproject.org/search?query=ansible-collection>`_
for a full list of Ansible collections packaged in Fedora.


Please `file a bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi>`_ against the
``Fedora`` product in Red Hat Bugzilla to reach the package maintainers.

Installing Ansible from EPEL
----------------------------------

Users of CentOS Stream, Almalinux, Rocky Linux, and related distributions
can install ``ansible`` or Ansible collections from the community maintained
`EPEL <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/>`_
(Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository.

After `enabling the EPEL repository <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/#_quickstart>`_,
users can use the same ``dnf`` commands as for Fedora Linux.

Please `file a bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi>`_ against the
``Fedora EPEL`` product in Red Hat Bugzilla to reach the package maintainers.


Installing Ansible on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed/Leap
----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo zypper install ansible
    
See `OpenSUSE Support Portal <https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Support>` for additional help with Ansible on OpenSUSE.

Installing Ansible on Ubuntu
----------------------------

Ubuntu builds are available `in a PPA here <https://launchpad.net/~ansible/+archive/ubuntu/ansible>`_.

To configure the PPA on your system and install Ansible run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install software-properties-common
    $ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
    $ sudo apt install ansible

.. note:: On older Ubuntu distributions, "software-properties-common" is called "python-software-properties". You may want to use ``apt-get`` rather than ``apt`` in older versions. Also, be aware that only newer distributions (that is, 18.04, 18.10, and later) have a ``-u`` or ``--update`` flag. Adjust your script as needed.




Installing Ansible on Debian
----------------------------

Debian users can use the same source as the Ubuntu PPA (using the following table).

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Debian
    -
    - Ubuntu
  * - Debian 11 (Bullseye)
    - ->
    - Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
  * - Debian 10 (Buster)
    - ->
    - Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)


.. note::

    Ansible releases are only built for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) or later releases.

Add the following line to ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` or ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ansible.list``:

.. code-block:: bash

    deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu MATCHING_UBUNTU_CODENAME_HERE main

Example for Debian 11 (Bullseye)

.. code-block:: bash

    deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu focal main

Then run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 93C4A3FD7BB9C367
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install ansible



Installing Ansible on Arch Linux
--------------------------------

To install the full ``ansible`` package run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pacman -S ansible

To install the minimal ``ansible-core`` package run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pacman -S ansible-core

Several Ansible ecosystem packages are also available from the Arch Linux repositories as
standalone packages that users can install alongside ``ansible-core``.
See the `Arch Linux Packages index <https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=ansible>`_
for a full list of Ansible packages in Arch Linux.

Please `file a bug <https://bugs.archlinux.org/>`__ to reach the package maintainers.
