Getting started with Execution Environments
*******************************************

Execution Environments (EEs) are Ansible control nodes packaged as container images.
EEs remove complexity to scale out automation projects and make things like deployment operations much more straightforward.

EEs provide you with:

* Software dependency isolation
* Portability across teams and environments
* Separation from other automation content and tooling

You can use Ansible community EEs to get up and running.
Or you can easily build and deploy custom EEs with whatever packages and Ansible community collections you need for your project.

Visit `Getting started with Execution Environments <https://ansible.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started_ee/index.html>`_ in the Ansible ecosystem documentation.

Ansible ecosystem
-----------------

Using EEs with projects in the Ansible ecosystem lets you expand automation to lots of use cases:

* `Ansible Builder <https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/en/latest/>`_
* `Ansible Navigator <https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/>`_
* `Ansible AWX <https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/awx/en/latest/userguide/execution_environments.html#use-an-execution-environment-in-jobs>`_
* `Ansible Runner <https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/runner/en/stable/>`_
* VS Code `Ansible <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible>`_ and `Dev Containers <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers>`_ extensions

Visit the `Ansible ecosystem documentation <https://ansible.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ to find How Tos and tutorials for using EEs with Ansible projects.
