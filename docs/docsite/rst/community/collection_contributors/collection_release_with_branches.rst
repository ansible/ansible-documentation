Releasing collections with release branches
============================================

Collections MUST follow the `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ rules. See :ref:`releasing_collections` for high-level details.

  :local:


Release planning and announcement
----------------------------------

#. Announce your intention to release the collection in a corresponding pinned release issue/community pinboard of the collection and in the ``#ansible-community`` `Matrix/IRC channel <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#real-time-chat>`_. Repeat the announcement in any other dedicated channels if they exist.

#. Ensure all the other repository maintainers are informed about the time of the following release.


Releasing major collection versions
-------------------------------------

The new version is assumed to be ``X.0.0``.

1. Make sure that ``galaxy.yml`` contains the correct version number ``X.0.0``. If that is not the case, create a PR to update it. This will make sanity tests fail for all deprecations that have to be removed in ``X.0.0``, so this is potentially a lot of work and should have been done weeks before the major release.

2. Check the collection for deprecations that are planned for removal in the major release that were not reported by the sanity tests. Use past changelogs or run ``grep -r `X.0.0` plugins/`` in the repository.

3. If you are going to release the ``community.general`` and ``community.network`` collections, create a new ``backport-X`` label in the corresponding repositories. Copy the styles and descriptions from the corresponding existing labels.

4. Ensure you are in a default branch in your local fork. These examples use ``main``.

  .. code-block:: bash

    git status
    git checkout main     # if needed


5. Update your local fork:

  .. code-block:: bash

    git pull --rebase upstream main


Creating the release branch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a branch ``stable-X``. Replace ``X`` with a correct number and push it to the **upstream** repository, NOT to the ``origin``.:

  .. code-block:: bash

    git branch stable-X main
    git push upstream stable-X


2. Create and checkout to another branch from the ``main`` branch:

  .. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b update_repo


3. Update the version in ``galaxy.yml`` in the branch to the next **expected** version, for example, ``X.1.0``.


Creating the changelogs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Replace ``changelogs/changelog.yml`` with:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    ancestor: X.0.0
    releases: {}


2. Remove all changelog fragments from ``changelogs/fragments/``. Removing the changelog fragments ensures that every major release has a changelog describing changes since the last major release.

3. Add and commit all the changes made. Push the branch to the ``origin`` repository.

4. Create a pull request in the collection repository. If CI tests pass, merge the pull request since the ``main`` branch is expecting changes for the next minor/major versions

5. Switch to the ``stable-X`` branch.

6. In the ``stable-X`` branch, verify that ``galaxy.yml`` contains the correct version number ``X.0.0``.

7. In the ``stable-X`` branch, ensure that ``changelogs/changelog.yml`` contains a correct ancestor's version:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    ancestor: X-1.0.0
    releases: {}


8. In the ``stable-X`` branch, add a changelog fragment ``changelogs/fragments/X.0.0.yml`` with the content:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    release_summary: |-
      Write some text here that should appear as the release summary for this version.
      The format is reStructuredText, but not a list as for regular changelog fragments.
      This text will be inserted into the changelog.


  For example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    release_summary: This is release 2.0.0 of ``community.foo``, released on YYYY-MM-DD.


9. In the ``stable-X`` branch, generate the changelogs:

  .. code-block:: bash

    antsibull-changelog release --cummulative-release


10. In the ``stable-X`` branch, verify that the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` looks as expected.

11. In the ``stable-X`` branch, update ``README.md`` so that the changelog link points to ``/tree/stable-X/`` and no longer to ``/tree/main/``, and change badges respectively, for example, in case of AZP, add ``?branchName=stable-X`` to the AZP CI badge (https://dev.azure.com/ansible/community.xxx/_apis/build/status/CI?branchName=stable-X).

12. In the ``stable-X`` branch, add, commit, and push changes to ``README.md``, ``CHANGELOG.rst`` and ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``, and potentially deleted/archived fragments to the **upstream** repository, NOT to the ``origin``.


Publishing the collection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. In the ``stable-X`` branch, add an annotated tag to the last commit with the collection version ``X.0.0``. Pushing this tag to the ``upstream`` repository will make Zuul publish the collection on `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>`_.

  .. code-block:: bash

    git tag -n    # see current tags and their comments
    git tag -a NEW_VERSION -m "comment here"    # the comment can be, for example, "community.foo: 2.0.0"
    git push upstream NEW_VERSION


2. If the collection uses `Zuul <https://github.com/ansible/zuul-config/blob/master/README.rst>`_ for publishing its releases, wait until the new version is published on the collection's `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>`_ page. It will appear in a list of tarballs available to download.

3. If the release tarball did not appear within several hours after pushing the tag, try to re-tag the release commit and push the tag again. In the ``stable-X`` branch being at the release commit:

  .. code-block:: bash

    git tag --delete NEW_VERSION
    git push upstream :NEW_VERSION
    git tag -a NEW_VERSION -m "comment here"    # the comment can be, for example, "community.foo: 2.0.0"
    git push upstream NEW_VERSION


4. Add a GitHub release for the new tag. The title should be the version and content, such as -  ``See https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.xxx/blob/stable-X/CHANGELOG.rst for all changes``.

5. Announce the release through the `Bullhorn Newsletter <https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn>`_.

6. Announce the release in the pinned release issue/community pinboard of the collection and in the ``#ansible-community`` `Matrix/Libera.Chat IRC channel <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#real-time-chat>`_.

7. In the ``stable-X`` branch, update the version in ``galaxy.yml`` to the next **expected** version, for example, ``X.1.0``. Add, commit and push to the **upstream** repository.


Releasing minor collection versions
-------------------------------------

The new version is assumed to be ``X.Y.0``. All changes that should go into it are expected to be previously backported from the default branch to the ``stable-X`` branch.

Creating the changelogs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. In the ``stable-X`` branch, make sure that ``galaxy.yml`` contains the correct version number ``X.Y.0``. If not, update it.

2. In the ``stable-X`` branch, add a changelog fragment ``changelogs/fragments/X.Y.0.yml`` with content:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    release_summary: |-
      Write some text here that should appear as the release summary for this version.
      The format is reStructuredText, but not a list as for regular changelog fragments.
      This text will be inserted into the changelog.


3. In the ``stable-X`` branch, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

   antsibull-changelog release


4. In the ``stable-X`` branch, verify that ``CHANGELOG.rst`` looks as expected.

5. In the ``stable-X`` branch, add, commit, and push changes to ``CHANGELOG.rst`` and ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``, and potentially deleted/archived fragments to the **upstream** repository, NOT to the origin.


Publishing the collection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. In the ``stable-X`` branch, add an annotated tag to the last commit with the collection version ``X.Y.0``. Pushing this tag to the ``upstream`` repository will make Zuul publish the collection on `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>`_.

  .. code-block:: bash

   git tag -n    # see current tags and their comments
   git tag -a NEW_VERSION -m "comment here"    # the comment can be, for example, "community.foo: 2.1.0"
   git push upstream NEW_VERSION


2. Wait until the new version is published on the collection's `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>`_ page. The published version will appear in a list of tarballs available to download.

3. Add a GitHub release for the new tag. The title should be the version and content, such as -  ``See https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.xxx/blob/stable-X/CHANGELOG.rst for all changes``.

4. Announce the release through the `Bullhorn Newsletter <https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn>`_.

5. Announce the release in the pinned release issue/community pinboard of the collection and in the ``#ansible-community`` `Matrix/IRC channel <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#real-time-chat>`_. Additionally, you can announce it using GitHub's Releases system.

6. In the ``stable-X`` branch, update the version in ``galaxy.yml`` to the next **expected** version, for example, if you have released ``X.1.0``, the next expected version could be ``X.2.0``. Add, commit and push to the **upstream** repository.

7. Checkout to the ``main`` branch.

8. In the ``main`` branch:

  #. If more minor versions are released before the next major version, update the version in ``galaxy.yml`` to ``X.(Y+1).0`` as well. Create a dedicated pull request and merge.

  #. If the next version will be a new major version, create a pull request where you update the version in ``galaxy.yml`` to ``(X+1).0.0``. Note that the sanity tests will most likely fail since there will be deprecations with removal scheduled for ``(X+1).0.0``, which are flagged by the tests.

  For every such deprecation, decide:
  
  * Whether to remove them now. For example, you remove the complete ``modules/plugins`` or you remove redirects. 
  * Whether to add ignore entries to the corresponding ``tests/sanity/ignore-*.txt`` file and create issues, for example for removed features in ``modules/plugins``.

  Once the CI tests pass, merge the pull request. Make sure that this pull request is merged not too much later after the release
  for ``version_added`` sanity tests not to expect the wrong version for the new feature pull request.

.. note::

  It makes sense to already do some removals in the days before the release. These removals must happen in the main branch and must not be backported.


Releasing patch versions
-------------------------

The new version is assumed to be ``X.Y.Z``, and the previous patch version is assumed to be ``X.Y.z`` with ``z < Z``.  ``z`` is frequently ``0`` since patch releases are uncommon.

Releasing when more minor versions are expected
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Checkout the ``X.Y.z`` tag.

2. Update ``galaxy.yml`` so that the version is ``X.Y.Z``. Add and commit.

3. Cherry-pick all changes from ``stable-X`` that were added after ``X.Y.z`` and should go into ``X.Y.Z``.

4. Add a changelog fragment ``changelogs/fragments/X.Y.Z.yml`` with content:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    release_summary: |-
      Write some text here that should appear as the release summary for this version.
      The format is reStructuredText but not a list as for regular changelog fragments.
      This text will be inserted into the changelog.

  Add to git and commit.

5. Generate the changelogs.

.. code-block:: bash

   antsibull-changelog release

6. Verify that ``CHANGELOG.rst`` looks as expected.

7. Add and commit changes to ``CHANGELOG.rst`` and ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``, and potentially deleted/archived fragments.

**Publishing the collection**


1. Add an annotated tag to the last commit with the collection version ``X.Y.Z``. Pushing this tag to the ``upstream`` repository will make Zuul publish the collection on `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>`_.

  .. code-block:: bash

   git tag -n    # see current tags and their comments
   git tag -a NEW_VERSION -m "comment here"    # the comment can be, for example, "community.foo: 2.1.1"
   git push upstream NEW_VERSION


2. Wait until the new version is published on the collection's `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>`_ page. It will appear in a list of tarballs available to download.

3. Add a GitHub release for the new tag. The title should be the version and content, such as - ``See https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.xxx/blob/stable-X/CHANGELOG.rst for all changes``.

  .. note::

    The data for this release is only contained in a tag, and not in a branch, in particular not in ``stable-X``.
    This is deliberate, since the next minor release ``X.(Y+1).0`` already contains the changes for ``X.Y.Z`` as well since these were cherry-picked from ``stable-X``.


4. Announce the release through the `Bullhorn Newsletter <https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn>`_.

5. Announce the release in the pinned release issue/community pinboard of the collection and in the ``#ansible-community`` `Matrix/IRC channel <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#real-time-chat>`.


Releasing when no more minor versions are expected
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. In the ``stable-X`` branch, make sure that ``galaxy.yml`` contains the correct version number ``X.Y.Z``. If not, update it!

2. In the ``stable-X`` branch, add a changelog fragment ``changelogs/fragments/X.Y.Z.yml`` with content:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    release_summary: |-
      Write some text here that should appear as the release summary for this version.
      The format is reStructuredText, but not a list as for regular changelog fragments.
      This text will be inserted into the changelog.


3. Generate the changelogs in the ``stable-X`` branch.

  .. code-block:: bash

   antsibull-changelog release


4. In the ``stable-X`` branch, verify that ``CHANGELOG.rst`` looks as expected.

5. In the ``stable-X`` branch, add, commit, and push changes to ``CHANGELOG.rst`` and ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``, and potentially deleted/archived fragments to the **upstream** repository, NOT to the origin.
