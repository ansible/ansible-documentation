Code of Conduct
===============

All communication and interactions in the Ansible Community are governed by our :ref:`code_of_conduct`. Please read and understand it!

.. _ansible_forum:

Forum
=====

The `Ansible Community Forum <https://forum.ansible.com>`_ is a single starting point for questions and help, development discussions, events, and much more. `Register <https://forum.ansible.com/signup?>`_ to join the community. Search by categories and tags to find interesting topics or start a new one; subscribe only to topics you need!

Take a look at the `forum groups <https://forum.ansible.com/g>`_ and join ones that match your interests.
In most cases, joining a forum group automatically subscribes you to related posts.

Want to create a group?
Request it in the `forum topic <https://forum.ansible.com/t/requesting-a-forum-group/503>`_.

.. _communication_irc:

Real-time chat
==============

For real-time interactions, conversations in the Ansible community happen over two chat protocols: Matrix and IRC. We maintain a bridge between Matrix and IRC, so you can choose whichever protocol you prefer. All channels exist in both places. Join a channel any time to ask questions, participate in a Working Group meeting, or just say hello.

Ansible community on Matrix
---------------------------

To join the community using Matrix, you need two things:

* a Matrix account (from `Matrix.org <https://app.element.io/#/register>`_ or any other Matrix homeserver)
* a `Matrix client <https://matrix.org/clients/>`_ (we recommend `Element Webchat <https://app.element.io>`_)

The Ansible community maintains its own Matrix homeserver at ``ansible.im``, however, public registration is currently unavailable.

Matrix chat supports:

* persistence (when you log on, you see all messages since you last logged off)
* edits (Let you fix typos and so on. **NOTE** Each edit you make on Matrix re-sends the message to IRC. Please try to avoid multiple edits!)
* replies to individual users
* reactions/emojis
* bridging to IRC
* no line limits
* images

The room links in the :ref:`general_channels` or the :ref:`working_group_list` list will take you directly to the relevant rooms.

If there is no appropriate room for your community, please create it.

For more information, see the community-hosted `Matrix FAQ <https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/community-matrix-faq>`_.

You can add Matrix shields to your repository's ``README.md`` using the shield in the `community-topics <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics#community-topics>`_ repository as a template.

Ansible community on IRC
------------------------

The Ansible community maintains several IRC channels on `irc.libera.chat <https://libera.chat/>`_. To join the community using IRC, you need one thing:

* an IRC client

IRC chat supports:

* no persistence (you only see messages when you are logged on unless you add a bouncer)
* simple text interface
* bridging from Matrix

Our IRC channels may require you to register your IRC nickname. If you receive an error when you connect or when posting a message, see `libera.chat's Nickname Registration guide <https://libera.chat/guides/registration>`_ for instructions. To find all ``ansible`` specific channels on the libera.chat network, use the following command in your IRC client:

.. code-block:: text

   /msg alias LIST #ansible* -min 5

as described in the `libera.chat docs <https://libera.chat/guides/findingchannels>`_.

Our channels record history on the Matrix side. The channel history can be viewed in a browser - all channels will report an appropriate link to ``chat.ansible.im`` in their Chanserv entrymsg upon joining the room. Alternatively, a URL of the form ``https://chat.ansible.im/#/room/# {IRC channel name}:libera.chat`` will also work, for example -  for the #ansible-docs channel it would be `https://app.element.io/#/room/#ansible-docs:libera.chat`.

.. _general_channels:

General channels
----------------

The clickable links will take you directly to the relevant Matrix room in your browser; room/channel information is also given for use in other clients:

- `Community social room and posting news for the Bullhorn newsletter <https://matrix.to:/#/#social:ansible.com>`_ - ``Matrix: #social:ansible.com | IRC: #ansible-social``

   - We will generally announce these on one or more of the above mailing lists. See the `meeting schedule <https://github.com/ansible-community/meetings/blob/main/README.md>`_

.. _working_group_list:

Working groups
==============

Working Groups are a way for Ansible community members to self-organize around particular topics of interest.

Our community working groups are represented in Matrix rooms and  `Forum groups <https://forum.ansible.com/g>`_.

Many of them meet in chat. If you want to get involved in a working group, join the Matrix room or IRC channel where it meets or comment on the agenda.

Forming a new working group
----------------------------

The basic components of a working group are:

* Group name and charter (why the group exists).
* Registered :ref:`real-time chat channel<communication_irc>`.
* Group of users (at least two!) who will be driving the agenda of the working group.
* Dedicated `forum group <https://forum.ansible.com/g>`_.

The basic responsibilities of a working group are:

* Follow the :ref:`code_of_conduct`.
* Be responsive on your real-time chat channel.
* Be responsive on the `forum <https://forum.ansible.com/>`_ in related topics.
* Report semi-regularly on the cool stuff that your working group is working on.
* Keep your forum group information updated.


Requesting a working group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Anyone can request to start a Working Group, for any reason. 

If you need only a `Forum group <https://forum.ansible.com/g>`_, 
request it in the `forum topic <https://forum.ansible.com/t/requesting-a-forum-group/503>`_.


If you also need a real-time chat channel, you can `request one <https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/community-matrix-faq#How-do-I-create-a-public-community-room>`_.


Ansible Community Topics
========================

The `Ansible Community Steering Committee <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html>`_ uses the `community-topics repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues>`_ to asynchronously discuss with the Community and vote on Community topics in corresponding issues.

Create a new issue in the `repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues>`_ if you want to discuss an idea that impacts any of the following:

* Ansible Community
* Community collection best practices and `requirements <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/collection_contributors/collection_requirements.html>`_
* `Community collection inclusion policy <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/blob/main/README.md>`_
* `The Community governance <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html>`_
* Other proposals of importance that need the Committee or overall Ansible community attention

Ansible Automation Platform support questions
=============================================

Red Hat Ansible `Automation Platform <https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-platform>`_ is a subscription that contains support, certified content, and tooling for Ansible including content management, a controller, UI and REST API.

If you have a question about Ansible Automation Platform, visit `Red Hat support <https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-ansible-automation-platform/>`_ rather than using a chat channel or the general project mailing list.

The Bullhorn
============

**The Bullhorn** is our newsletter for the Ansible contributor community. You can get Bullhorn updates
from the :ref:`forum` or `subscribe <https://eepurl.com/gZmiEP>`_ to receive it.

If you have any questions or content you would like to share, you are welcome to chat with us
in the `Ansible Social room on Matrix<https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com>, and mention
`newsbot <https://matrix.to/#/@newsbot:ansible.im>`_ to have your news item tagged for review for 
the next weekly issue.

Read past issues of `the Bullhorn <https://forum.ansible.com/c/news/bullhorn/17>`_.
