Reporting a bug
===============

Security bugs
-------------

Ansible practices responsible disclosure. To report security-related bugs, send an email to  `security@ansible.com <mailto:security@ansible.com>`_ for an immediate response. Do not submit a  ticket or post to any public groups.

Bugs in ansible-core
--------------------

Before reporting a bug, search in GitHub for `already reported issues <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues>`_ and `open pull requests <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pulls>`_ to see if someone has already addressed your issue.  Unsure if you found a bug? Discuss the behavior with the community on the :ref:`Ansible Forum<ansible_forum>`.

Also, use the :ref:`Ansible Forum<ansible_forum>` to discuss whether the problem is in ``ansible-core`` or a collection, and for "how do I do this" type questions.

You need a free GitHub account to `report bugs <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues>`_ that affect:

- multiple plugins  
- a plugin that remained in the ansible/ansible repo  
- the overall functioning of Ansible  

How to write a good bug report
------------------------------

If you find a bug, open an issue using the `issue template <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.yml>`_. 

Fill out the issue template as completely and as accurately as possible. Include:

* your Ansible version
* the expected behavior and what you've tried, including the exact commands you were using or tasks you are running.
* the current behavior and why you think it is a bug
* the steps to reproduce the bug 
* a minimal reproducible example and comments describing examples
* any relevant configurations and the components you used
* any relevant output plus ``ansible -vvvv`` (debugging) output
* add the output of ``ansible-test-env --show`` when filing bug reports involving ``ansible-test``. 

When sharing YAML in playbooks, ensure that you preserve formatting using `code blocks  <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/>`_. For multiple-file content, use gist.github.com, more durable than Pastebin content.

.. _request_features:

Requesting a feature
====================

Before you request a feature, check what is :ref:`planned for future Ansible Releases <roadmaps>`. Check `existing pull requests tagged with feature <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature>`_.

To get your feature into Ansible, :ref:`submit a pull request <community_pull_requests>`, either against ansible-core or a collection. See also :ref:`ansible_collection_merge_requirements`. For ``ansible-core``, you can also open an issue in `ansible/ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues>`_  or in a corresponding collection repository (To find the correct issue tracker, refer to :ref:`Bugs in collections<reporting_bugs_in_collections>` ).
