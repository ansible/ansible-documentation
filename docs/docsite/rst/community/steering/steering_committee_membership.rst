.. _Absence or irregular participation removal process:

Absence or irregular participation in discussing topics and votes
..................................................................

In case of absence or irregular participation, the involuntarily removal process consists of the following steps:

#. Another Committee member (hereinafter the initiator) contacts the person by email asking if they are still interested in fulfilling their Committee member's duties.
#. If they respond that they are not interested, the initiator asks the person to step down on their own following the :ref:`Voluntarily leaving process<Voluntarily leaving process>`.
#. If there has been no response or stepping down issue created by the person within a reasonable time, the initiator notifies other Committee members about the situation.
#. In case of agreement among the Committee about the need for removal, the initiator provides a draft of a corresponding topic's description to the Committee by email for discussion and approval.

  * The topic's title is ``Steering Committee member audit.``. It must not contain the person's name or other identifying information.

  * The description must not contain or imply any forms of condemnation.

  * It must mention that the person has been inactive for an unknown reason for the last N months and that, in accordance with the Steering Committee policies, their place should be freed for another person who can continue their great job.

  * The description must mention person's achievements and thanks for their time and effort they spent serving for the Community, Committee, and the Project, and a hope that one day they will come back.

#. The initiator creates the topic in the `Community Topics <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues>`_ repository containing the description and the title from the draft.
#. The Committee members vote on the topic.

Ansible Community Code of Conduct violations
.............................................

In case of the `Ansible Community Code of Conduct <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html>`_ violations, the process is the same as above except steps 1-2. Instead:

#. The initiator reports the case to the Committee by email.

#. The Committee discusses the case internally, evaluates its severity, and possible solutions.

#. If the Committee concludes that the violation is not severe, it develops a proposal to the person on how the situation can be corrected and further interactions with the Community improved.

#. A Committee representative reaches out to the person with the proposal.

#. The removal process starts if:

  * The Committee decided that the severity of the violation excludes a possibility of further membership.

  * The person does not respond to the proposal.

  * The person explicitly rejects the proposal.

In case of starting the removal process, the topic's description in the reason's part changes correspondingly.
