Ansible community topics workflow
=================================

Overview
--------

This document describes the Ansible community topics workflow (herein after ``Workflow``) to provide guidance on successful resolving topics in an asynchronous way.

The Workflow is a set of actions that need to be done successively within the corresponding time frames.

.. note::

   If you have any ideas on how the Workflow can be improved, please create an issue in this repository or pull request against this document.

Creating a topic
----------------

Any person can `create a topic <https://forum.ansible.com/new-topic?title=topic%20title&body=topic%20body&category=project&tags=community-wg>`_ tagged with ``community-wg`` under the ``Project Discussions`` category in the `Ansible Forum <https://forum.ansible.com/>`_. A :ref:`Steering Committee member<steering_members>` can tag the forum post with `community-wg-nextmtg` to put it on the meeting agenda.

Workflow
--------

.. note::

  This is a rough scenario and it can vary depending on a topic's complexity and other nuances, for example, when there is a mass agreement upfront.

Preparation stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Committee person checks the topic content and asks the author, or other persons, to provide additional information if needed.

Discussion stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* If the topic is ready to be discussed, the Committee person:

  * Adds the ``community-wg-nextmtg`` tag if it needs to be discussed in the meeting.

  * Opens the discussion by adding a comment asking the Community and the Committee to take part in it.

* No synchronous discussion is needed (there are no blockers, complications, confusion, or impasses).

Voting stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Depending on the topic complexity, 1-2 weeks after the discussion was opened, the Committee person formulates vote options based on the prior discussion and gives participants a reasonable amount of time to propose changes to the options (no longer than a week). The person summarizes the options in a comment and also establishes a date when the vote begins if there are no objections about the options or vote date.
* In the vote date, the vote starts with a comment from a Committee person who opens the vote and establishes a date when the vote ends ($CURRENT_DATE + no longer than 21 days; Usually it should not exceed 14 days. 21 days should only be used if it is known that a lot of interested persons will likely not have time to vote in a 14 day period).
* The Committee person labels the topic with the ``active-vote`` tag.
* The Committee person adds ``[Vote ends on $YYYY-MM-DD]`` to the beginning of the topic description.
* A vote is actually two polls, one for the Steering Committee, one for everyone else. To create a vote in a topic:

  * Create a new post in the topic.

  * Click the ``gear`` button in the composer and select ``Build Poll``.

  * Click the ``gear`` in the Poll Builder for advanced mode.

  * Set up the options (generally this will be Single Choice but other poll types can be used).

  * Title it "Steering Committee vote" and "Limit voting" to the ``Steering Committee``.

  * Do not set the close date because it cannot be changed later.

  * Results should be "Always Visible" unless there is some good reason for the SC votes not to be public.

  * Submit the poll (the BBcode will appear in the post) and then repeat the above for the second poll.

    * The title should be "Community vote".

    * No group limitation.

Voting result stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The day after the last day of the vote, the Committee person:

  * Closes the polls.

  * Removes the ``active-vote`` tag.

  * Add a comment that the vote ended.

  * Changes the beginning of the topic's description to ``[Vote ended]``.

  * Creates a summary comment declaring the vote result.

* The vote result and final decision are announced via the `Bullhorn newsletter <https://forum.ansible.com/c/news/bullhorn/17>`_.


Implementation stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* If the topic implies some actions (if it does not, just mark this as complete), the Committee person:

  * Assigns the topic to the person who is responsible for performing the actions.

  * Add the ``being-implemented`` tag to the topic.

  * After the topic is implemented, the assignee:

  * Comments on the topic that the work is done.

  * Removes the ``being-implemented`` tag.

  * Add the ``implemented`` tag.

* If the topic implies actions related to the future Ansible Community package releases (for example, a collection exclusion), the Committee person:

  * Adds the ``scheduled-for-future-release`` tag to the topic.

  * Checks if there is a corresponding milestone in the `ansible-build-data <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/milestones>`_ repository. If there is no milestone, the person creates it.

  * Creates an issue in ansible-build-data that references the topic in community-topics, and adds it to the milestone.

Tools
-----

We have some `scripts <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/tree/main/scripts>`_ that can be used to create Ansible community announcements in the Bullhorn and similar places.
