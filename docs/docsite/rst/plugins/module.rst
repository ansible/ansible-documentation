Modules are the main building blocks of Ansible playbooks. Although we do not generally speak of "module plugins", a module is a type of plugin. For a developer-focused description of the differences between modules and other plugins, see :ref:`modules_vs_plugins`.

.. _enabling_modules:

Enabling modules
----------------

You can enable a custom module by dropping it into one of these locations:

* any directory added to the ``ANSIBLE_LIBRARY`` environment variable (``$ANSIBLE_LIBRARY`` takes a colon-separated list like ``$PATH``)
* ``~/.ansible/plugins/modules/``
* ``/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules/``

For more information on using local custom modules, see :ref:`local_modules`.
