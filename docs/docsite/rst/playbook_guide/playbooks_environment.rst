.. _playbooks_environment:

Setting the remote environment
==============================

.. versionadded:: 1.1

You can use the ``environment`` keyword at the play, block, or task level to set an environment variable for an action on a remote host. With this keyword, you can enable using a proxy for a task that does http requests, set the required environment variables for language-specific version managers, and more.

When you set a value with ``environment:`` at the play or block level, it is available only to tasks within the play or block that are executed by the same user. The ``environment:`` keyword does not affect Ansible itself, Ansible configuration settings, the environment for other users, or the execution of other plugins like lookups and filters. Variables set with ``environment:`` do not automatically become Ansible facts, even when you set them at the play level. You must include an explicit ``gather_facts`` task in your playbook and set the ``environment`` keyword on that task to turn these values into Ansible facts.

Setting the remote environment in a task
----------------------------------------

You can set the environment directly at the task level.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - hosts: all
      remote_user: root

      tasks:

        - name: Install cobbler
          ansible.builtin.package:
            name: cobbler
            state: present
          environment:
            http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080

You can reuse environment settings by defining them as variables in your play and accessing them in a task as you would access any stored Ansible variable.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - hosts: all
      remote_user: root

      # create a variable named "proxy_env" that is a dictionary
      vars:
        proxy_env:
          http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080

      tasks:

        - name: Install cobbler
          ansible.builtin.package:
            name: cobbler
            state: present
          environment: "{{ proxy_env }}"

You can store environment settings for reuse in multiple playbooks by defining them in a group_vars file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    # file: group_vars/boston

    ntp_server: ntp.bos.example.com
    backup: bak.bos.example.com
    proxy_env:
      http_proxy: http://proxy.bos.example.com:8080
      https_proxy: http://proxy.bos.example.com:8080

You can set the remote environment at the play level.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - hosts: testing

      roles:
         - php
         - nginx

      environment:
        http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080

These examples show proxy settings, but you can provide any number of settings this way.

Working with language-specific version managers
===============================================

Some language-specific version managers (such as rbenv and nvm) require you to set environment variables while these tools are in use. When using these tools manually, you usually source some environment variables from a script or from lines added to your shell configuration file. In Ansible, you can do this with the environment keyword at the play level.

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    ### A playbook demonstrating a common npm workflow:
    # - Check for package.json in the application directory
    # - If package.json exists:
    #   * Run npm prune
    #   * Run npm install

    - hosts: application
      become: false

      vars:
        node_app_dir: /var/local/my_node_app

      environment:
        NVM_DIR: /var/local/nvm
        PATH: /var/local/nvm/versions/node/v4.2.1/bin:{{ ansible_env.PATH }}

      tasks:
      - name: Check for package.json
        ansible.builtin.stat:
          path: '{{ node_app_dir }}/package.json'
        register: packagejson

      - name: Run npm prune
        ansible.builtin.command: npm prune
        args:
          chdir: '{{ node_app_dir }}'
        when: packagejson.stat.exists

      - name: Run npm install
        community.general.npm:
          path: '{{ node_app_dir }}'
        when: packagejson.stat.exists

.. note::
   The example above uses ``ansible_env`` as part of the PATH. Basing variables on ``ansible_env`` is risky. Ansible populates ``ansible_env`` values by gathering facts, so the value of the variables depends on the remote_user or become_user Ansible used when gathering those facts. If you change remote_user/become_user the values in ``ansible_env`` may not be the ones you expect.

.. warning::
    Environment variables are normally passed in clear text (shell plugin dependent) so they are not a recommended way of passing secrets to the module being executed.

You can also specify the environment at the task level.

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    ---
    - name: Install ruby 2.3.1
      ansible.builtin.command: rbenv install {{ rbenv_ruby_version }}
      args:
        creates: '{{ rbenv_root }}/versions/{{ rbenv_ruby_version }}/bin/ruby'
      vars:
        rbenv_root: /usr/local/rbenv
        rbenv_ruby_version: 2.3.1
      environment:
        CONFIGURE_OPTS: '--disable-install-doc'
        RBENV_ROOT: '{{ rbenv_root }}'
        PATH: '{{ rbenv_root }}/bin:{{ rbenv_root }}/shims:{{ rbenv_plugins }}/ruby-build/bin:{{ ansible_env.PATH }}'
