Asynchronous actions and polling
================================

By default, Ansible runs tasks synchronously, holding the connection to the remote node open until the action is completed. This means that, within a playbook, each task blocks the next task by default, and subsequent tasks will not run until the current task is completed. This behavior can create challenges. For example, a task may take longer to complete than the SSH session allows for, causing a timeout. Or you may want a long-running process to execute in the background while you perform other tasks concurrently. Asynchronous mode lets you control how long-running tasks are executed.

Asynchronous ad hoc tasks
-------------------------

You can execute long-running operations in the background with :ref:`ad hoc tasks <intro_adhoc>`. For example, to execute ``long_running_operation`` asynchronously in the background, with a timeout (``-B``) of 3600 seconds, and without polling (``-P``):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible all -B 3600 -P 0 -a "/usr/bin/long_running_operation --do-stuff"

To check on the job status later, use the ``async_status`` module, passing it the job ID that was returned when you ran the original job in the background:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible web1.example.com -m async_status -a "jid=488359678239.2844"

Ansible can also check on the status of your long-running job automatically with polling. In most cases, Ansible will keep the connection to your remote node open between polls. To run for 30 minutes and poll for status every 60 seconds:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible all -B 1800 -P 60 -a "/usr/bin/long_running_operation --do-stuff"

Poll mode is smart so all jobs will be started before polling begins on any machine. Be sure to use a high enough ``--forks`` value if you want to get all of your jobs started very quickly. After the time limit (in seconds) runs out (``-B``), the process on the remote nodes will be terminated.

Asynchronous mode is best suited to long-running shell commands or software upgrades. Running the copy module asynchronously, for example, does not do a background file transfer.

Asynchronous playbook tasks
---------------------------

:ref:`Playbooks <working_with_playbooks>` also support asynchronous mode and polling, with a simplified syntax. You can use asynchronous mode in playbooks to avoid connection timeouts or to avoid blocking subsequent tasks. The behavior of asynchronous mode in a playbook depends on the value of `poll`.

Avoid connection timeouts: poll > 0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to set a longer timeout limit for a certain task in your playbook, use ``async`` with ``poll`` set to a positive value. Ansible will still block the next task in your playbook, waiting until the async task either completes, fails or times out. However, the task will only time out if it exceeds the timeout limit you set with the ``async`` parameter.

To avoid timeouts on a task, specify its maximum runtime and how frequently you would like to poll for status:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---

    - hosts: all
      remote_user: root

      tasks:

      - name: Simulate long running op (15 sec), wait for up to 45 sec, poll every 5 sec
        ansible.builtin.command: /bin/sleep 15
        async: 45
        poll: 5

.. note::
   The default poll value is set by the :ref:`DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL` setting.
   There is no default for the async time limit.  If you leave off the
   'async' keyword, the task runs synchronously, which is Ansible's
   default.

.. note::
  As of Ansible 2.3, async does not support check mode and will fail the
  task when run in check mode. See :ref:`check_mode_dry` on how to
  skip a task in check mode.

.. note::
   When an async task completes with polling enabled, the temporary async job cache
   file (by default in ~/.ansible_async/) is automatically removed.

Run tasks concurrently: poll = 0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to run multiple tasks in a playbook concurrently, use ``async`` with ``poll`` set to 0. When you set ``poll: 0``, Ansible starts the task and immediately moves on to the next task without waiting for a result. Each async task runs until it either completes, fails or times out (runs longer than its ``async`` value). The playbook run ends without checking back on async tasks.

To run a playbook task asynchronously:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---

    - hosts: all
      remote_user: root

      tasks:

      - name: Simulate long running op, allow to run for 45 sec, fire and forget
        ansible.builtin.command: /bin/sleep 15
        async: 45
        poll: 0

.. note::
   Do not specify a poll value of 0 with operations that require exclusive locks (such as yum transactions) if you expect to run other commands later in the playbook against those same resources.

.. note::
   Using a higher value for ``--forks`` will result in kicking off asynchronous tasks even faster. This also increases the efficiency of polling.

.. note::
   When running with ``poll: 0``, Ansible will not automatically clean up the async job cache file.
   You will need to manually clean this up with the :ref:`async_status <async_status_module>` module
   with ``mode: cleanup``.

If you need a synchronization point with an async task, you can register it to obtain its job ID and use the :ref:`async_status <async_status_module>` module to observe it in a later task. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

        - name: Run an async task
          ansible.builtin.yum:
            name: docker-io
            state: present
          async: 1000
          poll: 0
          register: yum_sleeper

        - name: Check on an async task
          async_status:
            jid: "{{ yum_sleeper.ansible_job_id }}"
          register: job_result
          until: job_result.finished
          retries: 100
          delay: 10

.. note::
   If the value of ``async:`` is not high enough, this will cause the
   "check on it later" task to fail because the temporary status file that
   the ``async_status:`` is looking for will not have been written or no longer exist

.. note::
   Asynchronous playbook tasks always return changed. If the task is using a module
   that requires the user to annotate changes with ``changed_when``, ``creates``,  and so on,
   then those should be added to the following ``async_status`` task.

To run multiple asynchronous tasks while limiting the number of tasks running concurrently:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    #####################
    # main.yml
    #####################
    - name: Run items asynchronously in batch of two items
      vars:
        sleep_durations:
          - 1
          - 2
          - 3
          - 4
          - 5
        durations: "{{ item }}"
      include_tasks: execute_batch.yml
      loop: "{{ sleep_durations | batch(2) | list }}"

    #####################
    # execute_batch.yml
    #####################
    - name: Async sleeping for batched_items
      ansible.builtin.command: sleep {{ async_item }}
      async: 45
      poll: 0
      loop: "{{ durations }}"
      loop_control:
        loop_var: "async_item"
      register: async_results

    - name: Check sync status
      async_status:
        jid: "{{ async_result_item.ansible_job_id }}"
      loop: "{{ async_results.results }}"
      loop_control:
        loop_var: "async_result_item"
      register: async_poll_results
      until: async_poll_results.finished
      retries: 30
