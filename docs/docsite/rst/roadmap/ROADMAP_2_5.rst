Matt Davis (IRC/GitHub: @nitzmahone)


Engine improvements
-------------------

  - The same with diff, it should work as template modules does
- Handle Password reset prompts cleaner
- Tasks stats for rescues and ignores
- Normalize temp dir usage across all subsystems
- Add option to set playbook dir for adhoc, inventory and console to allow for 'relative path loading'

-----
- Namespacing fact variables (with a config option) implemented in ansible/ansible PR `#18445 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/18445>`_.
  Proposal found in ansible/proposals issue `#17 <https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/17>`_.
- Make fact collectors and gather_subset specs finer grained
- Eliminate unneeded deps between fact collectors
- Allow fact collectors to indicate if they need information from another fact collector to be gathered first.

Static Loop Keyword
