What is Desired State Configuration?
````````````````````````````````````
Desired State Configuration, or DSC, is a tool built into PowerShell that can
be used to define a Windows host setup through code. The overall purpose of DSC
is the same as Ansible, it is just executed in a different manner. Since
Ansible 2.4, the ``win_dsc`` module has been added and can be used to take advantage of
existing DSC resources when interacting with a Windows host.

More details on DSC can be viewed at `DSC Overview <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/overview?view=powershell-7.2>`_.

Host Requirements
`````````````````
To use the ``win_dsc`` module, a Windows host must have PowerShell v5.0 or
newer installed. All supported hosts can be upgraded to PowerShell v5.

Once the PowerShell requirements have been met, using DSC is as simple as
creating a task with the ``win_dsc`` module.

Why Use DSC?
````````````
DSC and Ansible modules have a common goal which is to define and ensure the state of a
resource. Because of
this, resources like the DSC `File resource <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/reference/resources/windows/fileresource>`_
and Ansible ``win_file`` can be used to achieve the same result. Deciding which to use depends
on the scenario.

Reasons for using an Ansible module over a DSC resource:

* The host does not support PowerShell v5.0, or it cannot easily be upgraded
* The DSC resource does not offer a feature present in an Ansible module. For example,
  win_regedit can manage the ``REG_NONE`` property type, while the DSC
  ``Registry`` resource cannot
* DSC resources have limited check mode support, while some Ansible modules have
  better checks
* DSC resources do not support diff mode, while some Ansible modules do
* Custom resources require further installation steps to be run on the host
  beforehand, while Ansible modules are built-in to Ansible
* There are bugs in a DSC resource where an Ansible module works

Reasons for using a DSC resource over an Ansible module:

* The Ansible module does not support a feature present in a DSC resource
* There is no Ansible module available
* There are bugs in an existing Ansible module

In the end, it doesn't matter whether the task is performed with DSC or an
Ansible module; what matters is that the task is performed correctly and the
playbooks are still readable. If you have more experience with DSC over Ansible
and it does the job, just use DSC for that task.

How to Use DSC?
```````````````
The ``win_dsc`` module takes in a free-form of options so that it changes
according to the resource it is managing. A list of built-in resources can be
found at `resources <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/resources/resources>`_.

Using the `Registry <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/reference/resources/windows/registryresource>`_
resource as an example, this is the DSC definition as documented by Microsoft:

.. code-block:: powershell

    Registry [string] #ResourceName
    {
        Key = [string]
        ValueName = [string]
        [ Ensure = [string] { Enable | Disable }  ]
        [ Force =  [bool]   ]
        [ Hex = [bool] ]
        [ DependsOn = [string[]] ]
        [ ValueData = [string[]] ]
        [ ValueType = [string] { Binary | Dword | ExpandString | MultiString | Qword | String }  ]
    }

When defining the task, ``resource_name`` must be set to the DSC resource being
used - in this case, the ``resource_name`` should be set to ``Registry``. The
``module_version`` can refer to a specific version of the DSC resource
installed; if left blank it will default to the latest version. The other
options are parameters that are used to define the resource, such as ``Key`` and
``ValueName``. While the options in the task are not case sensitive,
keeping the case as-is is recommended because it makes it easier to distinguish DSC
resource options from Ansible's ``win_dsc`` options.

This is what the Ansible task version of the above DSC Registry resource would look like:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    - name: Use win_dsc module with the Registry DSC resource
      win_dsc:
        resource_name: Registry
        Ensure: Present
        Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ExampleKey
        ValueName: TestValue
        ValueData: TestData

Starting in Ansible 2.8, the ``win_dsc`` module automatically validates the
input options from Ansible with the DSC definition. This means Ansible will
fail if the option name is incorrect, a mandatory option is not set, or the
value is not a valid choice. When running Ansible with a verbosity level of 3
or more (``-vvv``), the return value will contain the possible invocation
options based on the ``resource_name`` specified. Here is an example of the
invocation output for the above ``Registry`` task:

.. code-block:: ansible-output

    changed: [2016] => {
        "changed": true,
        "invocation": {
            "module_args": {
                "DependsOn": null,
                "Ensure": "Present",
                "Force": null,
                "Hex": null,
                "Key": "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\ExampleKey",
                "PsDscRunAsCredential_password": null,
                "PsDscRunAsCredential_username": null,
                "ValueData": [

                "ValueType": null,
                "module_version": "latest",
                "resource_name": "Registry"
            }
        },
        "module_version": "1.1",
        "reboot_required": false,
        "verbose_set": [
            "Perform operation 'Invoke CimMethod' with following parameters, ''methodName' = ResourceSet,'className' = MSFT_DSCLocalConfigurationManager,'namespaceName' = root/Microsoft/Windows/DesiredStateConfiguration'.",
            "An LCM method call arrived from computer SERVER2016 with user sid S-1-5-21-3088887838-4058132883-1884671576-1105.",
            "[SERVER2016]: LCM:  [ Start  Set      ]  [[Registry]DirectResourceAccess]",
            "[SERVER2016]:                            [[Registry]DirectResourceAccess] (SET) Create registry key 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\ExampleKey'",
            "[SERVER2016]:                            [[Registry]DirectResourceAccess] (SET) Set registry key value 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\ExampleKey\\TestValue' to 'TestData' of type 'String'",
            "[SERVER2016]: LCM:  [ End    Set      ]  [[Registry]DirectResourceAccess]  in 0.1930 seconds.",
            "[SERVER2016]: LCM:  [ End    Set      ]    in  0.2720 seconds.",
            "Operation 'Invoke CimMethod' complete.",
            "Time taken for configuration job to complete is 0.402 seconds"
        ],
        "verbose_test": [
            "Perform operation 'Invoke CimMethod' with following parameters, ''methodName' = ResourceTest,'className' = MSFT_DSCLocalConfigurationManager,'namespaceName' = root/Microsoft/Windows/DesiredStateConfiguration'.",
            "An LCM method call arrived from computer SERVER2016 with user sid S-1-5-21-3088887838-4058132883-1884671576-1105.",
            "[SERVER2016]: LCM:  [ Start  Test     ]  [[Registry]DirectResourceAccess]",
            "[SERVER2016]:                            [[Registry]DirectResourceAccess] Registry key 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\ExampleKey' does not exist",
            "[SERVER2016]: LCM:  [ End    Test     ]  [[Registry]DirectResourceAccess] False in 0.2510 seconds.",
            "[SERVER2016]: LCM:  [ End    Set      ]    in  0.3310 seconds.",
            "Operation 'Invoke CimMethod' complete.",
            "Time taken for configuration job to complete is 0.475 seconds"
        ]
    }

The ``invocation.module_args`` key shows the actual values that were set as
well as other possible values that were not set. Unfortunately, this will not
show the default value for a DSC property, only what was set from the Ansible
task. Any ``*_password`` option will be masked in the output for security
reasons; if there are any other sensitive module options, set ``no_log: True``
on the task to stop all task output from being logged.


Property Types
--------------
Each DSC resource property has a type that is associated with it. Ansible
will try to convert the defined options to the correct type during execution.
For simple types like ``[string]`` and ``[bool]``, this is a simple operation,
but complex types like ``[PSCredential]`` or arrays (like ``[string[]]``)
require certain rules.

PSCredential
++++++++++++
A ``[PSCredential]`` object is used to store credentials in a secure way, but
Ansible has no way to serialize this over JSON. To set a DSC PSCredential property,
the definition of that parameter should have two entries that are suffixed with
``_username`` and ``_password`` for the username and password, respectively.
For example:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    PsDscRunAsCredential_username: '{{ ansible_user }}'
    PsDscRunAsCredential_password: '{{ ansible_password }}'

    SourceCredential_username: AdminUser
    SourceCredential_password: PasswordForAdminUser

.. Note:: On versions of Ansible older than 2.8, you should set ``no_log: true``
    on the task definition in Ansible to ensure any credentials used are not
    stored in any log file or console output.

A ``[PSCredential]`` is defined with ``EmbeddedInstance("MSFT_Credential")`` in
a DSC resource MOF definition.

CimInstance Type
++++++++++++++++
A ``[CimInstance]`` object is used by DSC to store a dictionary object based on
a custom class defined by that resource. Defining a value that takes in a
``[CimInstance]`` in YAML is the same as defining a dictionary in YAML.
For example, to define a ``[CimInstance]`` value in Ansible:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    # [CimInstance]AuthenticationInfo == MSFT_xWebAuthenticationInformation
    AuthenticationInfo:
      Anonymous: false
      Basic: true
      Digest: false
      Windows: true

In the above example, the CIM instance is a representation of the class
`MSFT_xWebAuthenticationInformation <https://github.com/dsccommunity/xWebAdministration/blob/master/source/DSCResources/MSFT_xWebSite/MSFT_xWebSite.schema.mof>`_.
This class accepts four boolean variables, ``Anonymous``, ``Basic``,
``Digest``, and ``Windows``. The keys to use in a ``[CimInstance]`` depend on
the class it represents. Please read through the documentation of the resource
to determine the keys that can be used and the types of each key value. The
class definition is typically located in the ``<resource name>.schema.mof``.

HashTable Type
++++++++++++++
A ``[HashTable]`` object is also a dictionary but does not have a strict set of
keys that can/need to be defined. Like a ``[CimInstance]``, define it as a
normal dictionary value in YAML. A ``[HashTable]]`` is defined with
``EmbeddedInstance("MSFT_KeyValuePair")`` in a DSC resource MOF definition.

Arrays
++++++
Simple type arrays like ``[string[]]`` or ``[UInt32[]]`` are defined as a list
or as a comma-separated string which is then cast to their type. Using a list
is recommended because the values are not manually parsed by the ``win_dsc``
module before being passed to the DSC engine. For example, to define a simple
type array in Ansible:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    # [string[]]
    ValueData: entry1, entry2, entry3
    ValueData:
    - entry1
    - entry2
    - entry3

    # [UInt32[]]
    ReturnCode: 0,3010
    ReturnCode:
    - 0
    - 3010

Complex type arrays like ``[CimInstance[]]`` (array of dicts), can be defined
like this example:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    # [CimInstance[]]BindingInfo == MSFT_xWebBindingInformation
    BindingInfo:
    - Protocol: https
      Port: 443
      CertificateStoreName: My
      CertificateThumbprint: C676A89018C4D5902353545343634F35E6B3A659
      HostName: DSCTest
      IPAddress: '*'
      SSLFlags: 1
    - Protocol: http
      Port: 80
      IPAddress: '*'

The above example is an array with two values of the class `MSFT_xWebBindingInformation <https://github.com/dsccommunity/xWebAdministration/blob/master/source/DSCResources/MSFT_xWebSite/MSFT_xWebSite.schema.mof>`_.
When defining a ``[CimInstance[]]``, be sure to read the resource documentation
to find out what keys to use in the definition.

DateTime
++++++++
A ``[DateTime]`` object is a DateTime string representing the date and time in
the `ISO 8601 <https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime>`_ date time format. The
value for a ``[DateTime]`` field should be quoted in YAML to ensure the string
is properly serialized to the Windows host. Here is an example of how to define
a ``[DateTime]`` value in Ansible:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    # As UTC-0 (No timezone)
    DateTime: '2019-02-22T13:57:31.2311892+00:00'

    # As UTC+4
    DateTime: '2019-02-22T17:57:31.2311892+04:00'

    # As UTC-4
    DateTime: '2019-02-22T09:57:31.2311892-04:00'

All the values above are equal to a UTC date time of February 22nd 2019 at
1:57pm with 31 seconds and 2311892 milliseconds.

Run As Another User
-------------------
By default, DSC runs each resource as the SYSTEM account and not the account
that Ansible uses to run the module. This means that resources that are dynamically
loaded based on a user profile, like the ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER`` registry hive,
will be loaded under the ``SYSTEM`` profile. The parameter
``PsDscRunAsCredential`` is a parameter that can be set for every DSC resource, and
force the DSC engine to run under a different account. As
``PsDscRunAsCredential`` has a type of ``PSCredential``, it is defined with the
``_username`` and ``_password`` suffix.

Using the Registry resource type as an example, this is how to define a task
to access the ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER`` hive of the Ansible user:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    - name: Use win_dsc with PsDscRunAsCredential to run as a different user
      win_dsc:
        resource_name: Registry
        Ensure: Present
        Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\ExampleKey
        ValueName: TestValue
        ValueData: TestData
        PsDscRunAsCredential_username: '{{ ansible_user }}'
        PsDscRunAsCredential_password: '{{ ansible_password }}'
      no_log: true

Custom DSC Resources
````````````````````
DSC resources are not limited to the built-in options from Microsoft. Custom
modules can be installed to manage other resources that are not usually available.

Finding Custom DSC Resources
----------------------------
You can use the
`PSGallery <https://www.powershellgallery.com/>`_ to find custom resources, along with documentation on how to install them  on a Windows host.

The ``Find-DscResource`` cmdlet can also be used to find custom resources. For example:

.. code-block:: powershell

    # Find all DSC resources in the configured repositories
    Find-DscResource

    # Find all DSC resources that relate to SQL
    Find-DscResource -ModuleName "*sql*"

.. Note:: DSC resources developed by Microsoft that start with ``x`` means the
    resource is experimental and comes with no support.

Installing a Custom Resource
----------------------------
There are three ways that a DSC resource can be installed on a host:

* Manually with the ``Install-Module`` cmdlet
* Using the ``win_psmodule`` Ansible module
* Saving the module manually and copying it to another host

The following is an example of installing the ``xWebAdministration`` resources using
``win_psmodule``:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    - name: Install xWebAdministration DSC resource
      win_psmodule:
        name: xWebAdministration
        state: present

Once installed, the win_dsc module will be able to use the resource by referencing it
with the ``resource_name`` option.

The first two methods above only work when the host has access to the internet.
When a host does not have internet access, the module must first be installed
using the methods above on another host with internet access and then copied
across. To save a module to a local filepath, the following PowerShell cmdlet
can be run:

.. code-block:: powershell

    Save-Module -Name xWebAdministration -Path C:\temp

This will create a folder called ``xWebAdministration`` in ``C:\temp``, which
can be copied to any host. For PowerShell to see this offline resource, it must
be copied to a directory set in the ``PSModulePath`` environment variable.
In most cases, the path ``C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Module`` is set
through this variable, but the ``win_path`` module can be used to add different
paths.
